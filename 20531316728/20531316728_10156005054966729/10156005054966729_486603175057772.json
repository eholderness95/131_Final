Recently I've changed my project's name from \"GREAT!\" (my nickname) to \"Robert Grozav\" (my name). My community calls me both ways, so there is no confusion created. Even so, Facebook doesn't agree with me and won't accept my request to change my page's name from \"GREAT!\" to \"Robert Grozav\" saying it might be \"confusing\" for my fans. However, it is completely FALSE, since my community is already aware of this change and it doesn't represent any kind of risk. \n\nI've sent over 20 requests to Facebook, but no help.\nInstagram and YouTube already accepted my request, yet Facebook didn't and is dragging my business down. \n\nPlease, help me regarding this issue."
