        "message": "In the last 24 hours, something has changed. When I am in Messenger, suddenly the typing box has shrunk to only one character high (sometimes it is LESS than a full character, sometimes it is 1/2 of a character high). I noticed that the icons that used to appear to the right of the typing box now switched to appear at the bottom of the typing box, and they are taking up all of the space that I used to have for typing a message.  With the typing box so small, I canot view what I have typed or edit my message before hitting \"send\". I do NOT want to enlarge my entire window. I simply want to go back to being able to see 5 or 6 lines of the message I have typed before hitting \"send\".  Can someone help me to do that?"
