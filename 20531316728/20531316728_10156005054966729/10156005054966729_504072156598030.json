        "message": "Hi, Guys .. I tried to change to my Fb band page, but was denied. I appealed the decision but haven't heard anything. Our current band name is Southbound and want to change to The Dixie Tornados. There are so many bands in our area with south in the name our band gets confused with other bands. Please any help you can give us will be appreciated. Thanks, Joseph Wells"
