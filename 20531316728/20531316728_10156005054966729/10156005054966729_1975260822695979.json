No matter what site I visit or what a \"like\" I get a \"content exception\" interruption. this is extremely annoying. I am a Grandmother and I only \"like\" photos of family, pets and so on. I even got this Content exception interruption when visiting your page! How can I fix this, or will you please do it?  I can't post photos either, some Content exception pops up. Please HELP!"
