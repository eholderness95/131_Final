You've been blocked from using it.\"\n\nSo, how fast is too fast? Is there a ballpark figure or something, so I know just how many comments I can show my support of (or disgust with) without getting a 24-hour reacting banhammer? What's the point of having the ability to react to things if we can't freaking do it?"
