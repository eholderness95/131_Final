            "message": "Hi Kathleen. You can change who can see your birthday by adjusting the audience. There are 2 audience selectors next to your birthday: one for the day and month and one for the year. Friends won't get a notification about your upcoming birthday if you don't share the day and month with them. Learn more: http://bit.ly/2vjFIt9. -William"
