Here is my problem:  Greetings Facebook, I have several facebook pages that I have sent in messages to you about; not having full access to my entire Friend List to INVITE my own friends to my pages. Facebook is only allowing me to access about 100 of my 2300 friends on my list. However when I go to some else's page I can access my entire friend list to INVITE my Friends to another persons page but not my own. How can I effectively market ADS to my friends if I can't even INVITE them to my page? PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS ISSUE!!!! Papyrus Herbals Online page can not access my EmpressDiamond Akhanki Buchangofull friend list to INVITE"
