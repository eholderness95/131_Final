Have a newsfeed that does not have crap from a week ago show up first just because someone comments on it. Everything should be from the date and time it was posted. Not because some stupid computer thinks I want to see it. Me and my clients all have moved our advertising dollars away from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn for this reason. People just keep an account to store images and wish people happy birthday. They are all a complete waste of advertising dollars. Google is paying off big for us."
