        "message": "Dear @facebook your reporting still leaves much to be desired. If an account has been hacked and is posting money scam messages, it is not possible to report it directly under \"i want to help\" that would specify that the actual owner is not the culprit. \nSo when profile is reported, sometimes you take no action and you let criminals continue scamming. Not happy with that, as scamming is a very common issue."
