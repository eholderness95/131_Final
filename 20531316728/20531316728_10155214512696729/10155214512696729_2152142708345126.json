Then I have to go all the way down again to find what I was looking at. It refreshes all the time making me have to start back from the top again. I don't even bother reading articles or long posts anymore bc fb won't let me finish without going back to the beginning of the newsfeed."

Same things over and over\n\nStop this.  If we like something and WANT to SHARE it we can.  You have a button for just this very thing it is called the Share Button.  If I like something others have Shared or Posted and then they comment on it I get a Notification so I can revisit it if I want to.\n\nNo I do not like all the stuff my friend X likes.  No I do not want to see links to every article friends have liked or commented on. And FYI this more than anything is how I come into contact with FAKE NEWs crap others have liked or commented on but not shared is posted in my Newsfeed"
