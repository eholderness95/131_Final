        "message": "Today I started getting notifications of new posts and shares made by pages I like. It seems that the only way to turn that off is to manually turn notifications off on every page I like. When you like hundreds of pages, that's not a very efficient solution. I want my notifications to be about things that are directly related to me. Posts and shares by pages should show up in my newsfeed. Please change this back, or make a way to turn off notifications for all pages with one click rather than doing so on each individual page."
