SENYORA has brought joy and laughter to millions of Filipinos since it was created in 2013. Because the Page is such a hit, a publisher even compiled SENYORA's posts into a book entitled \"Lakompake,\" published last year (http://www.nationalbookstore.com/books/lakompake-ang-babaeng-bukod-na-pinagpala-sa-lahat.html). \n\nI believe that SENYORA has been targeted because it's a Page that openly supports Duterte. This is definitely a POLITICALLY MOTIVATED mass report as SENYORA is one of the biggest Duterte Supporter FB Pages in the Philippines, with over 2 million followers.\n\nThank you."
