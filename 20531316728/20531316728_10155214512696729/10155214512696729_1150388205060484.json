        "message": "Listen, I understand this has been brought up before MANY times since facebook has started the started memories posting. But my mom for the third time after I shut it off and took off pictures/post..ect still had something put on her facebook of someone who died and it REALLY upset her, she started crying and got mad. I've asked about fixing this and for some reason facebook thinks its okay. How would you like bad memories being shoved back into your face when you thought you've moved on. I don't understand how facebook gains from that but I frankly don't care. I want it off my and her's facebook. Even when I take this crap off it still shows up."
