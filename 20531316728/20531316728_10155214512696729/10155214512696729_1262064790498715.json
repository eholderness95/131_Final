Like today...\nWhy is it that I can post something to a group yesterday yet today there is no way to do so unless I post then edit.\n Also, why is it that the one person I barely know has permission to post on my Timeline with no review, yet everyone else has to be checked. I have changed my settings to many times to count.\nFacebook is sooooo annoying!"
