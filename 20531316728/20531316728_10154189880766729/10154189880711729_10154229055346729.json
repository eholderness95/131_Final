        "message": "Dear Facebook, I'd appreciate your effort if you create the same flag when the unarmed civilians are killed anywhere in the world,when people of Palestine, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Nigeria, Kashmir are killed & you stay shut. I wonder if people are gonna be changing their Profile Picture. ISIS is a dirty game in America, a second Big Game after the creation of Taliban to fool people around the globe start to believe on this. ISIS is a direct outcome of US invasion of Iraq to give them some \" Freedom\" & western funding of rogue rebel groups against Assad regime in Syria. Western imperialist policies, invasions, wars and proxy wars create terrorist groups like ISIS, their recruitment fueled by hatred towards western imperialist agenda. Its Western Imperialism and Power Politics that are to blame for terrorism, not religion, and certainly not Islam."
