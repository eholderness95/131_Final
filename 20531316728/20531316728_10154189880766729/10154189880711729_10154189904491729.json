If u need a celebrity to tell u to pray for ur home then u are also part of the problem ...This is about Paris and the senseless act that happened today , so if for once we can all come together and pray for the lives of the lost rather than create conflict. #prayforparis #prayfortheworld"

Facebook changed the flag today to France flag for having empathy with people. Just 2 days ago same explosion happend in Beirut. They exploded Russia airplane with 200 innocent people. They burned 400 innocent children last week. Did you see any of this reactions!? And now every one is saying Muslims are terrorists. No one sees if yesterday 150 Muslim and non-Muslim died every day hundreds of just Muslims are dying by same group"
