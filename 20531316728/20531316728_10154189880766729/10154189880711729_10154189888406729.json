Yes it's sad that innocents are in the crossfire as it cannot be prevented because in war people die. It's just a fact. However, if we did not go to war, and we did not do our best to stop terrorist, those innocents still would have died and so would have far many more. If no one did anything to help your countries with terror then all of this would be far worse because Isis and all terrorist organizations before would have one and then where would you be? Probably not posting your problems on the internet that's for sure"
