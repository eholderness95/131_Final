        "message": "this is just stupid, a month ago there was a terrorist attack in middle of Ankara, bomb exploded causing dozens of people dead, and hundreds injured... before that there was one in Beirut yesterday, and several more in Turkey past couple of months, but somehow Facebook never supported, never took any action for it. I am not saying that I do not mourn for those in France, I'm just questioning these double standards against Muslim countries. Terrorist killing muslims is not someting to support muslims cuz guess what? the whole world thinks that muslims, the whole religion and all of them are supporting and are terrorists. Thank you America and all others who did a real great job on branding muslims as terrorists. \nP.s. Facebook when you decide to \"change your profile picture\" or post something to support against terrorism, do it for every person/city/country/religion."
