        "message": "R.I.P to the victims of the #ParisAttacks. #prayforparis .....terrorism has no religion....we all condemn terrorist attack on france...But it baffles the mind how the western media pretty much neglect to report the same acts of terrorism in the Middle East and other third world countries, but are quick to spread and broadcast the news when it relates to the western countries. There are innocent lives shed all over the world, not only in the West.\n'Pray for Paris.\nBut also pray for Baghdad\nFor Beirut \nFor Sanaa \nFor Aden \nFor Karbala \nFor Najaf \nFor Mosul \nFor Diyarbakir \nFor Mogadishu\nFor Kandahar \nFor Kabul \nFor Islamabad\nFor Damascus \nFor Homs \nFor the innocent, trapped people of Raqqa For the Sinai Peninsula \nFor Qatif and al-Hasa governate, Saudi Arabia \nFor Bahrain \nFor Gaza \nFor the West Bank\nAnd EVERY SINGLE city and country that has been a victim of western imperialism and 'islamist' extremism.\nI am not Paris, nor France. I am Humanity.'"
