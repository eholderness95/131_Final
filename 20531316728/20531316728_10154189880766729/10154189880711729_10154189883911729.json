France is America's oldest ally and that is why there is so much floating around the Paris attacks. We are showing support after all the wars France has helped us with. After their support for us during 9/11. Stop being so hateful. It's not that we don't care or that we are not trying to help. However the USA can only do so much and as alliances go we are showing France that we are there for them. But we are there for all. It may take a few years but we will defeat Isis and that is what we should all be fighting together for. To stop terrorism and bring peace to all."
