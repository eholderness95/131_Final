People using the hashtag pray for the world just because of the recent attacks in Paris? So that's what it takes for them to realize we need to pray for the world? That's ridiculous. I do feel sorry for the terrorists attacks in Paris but I also feel sorry for the whole middle east, all the innocent lives being taken every single day. I'm not part of this hypocrite movement \"pray for France\" when middle east has been needing it for way way longer. It's like these people close their eyes for what's really happening and they only see what they want. Ugh."
