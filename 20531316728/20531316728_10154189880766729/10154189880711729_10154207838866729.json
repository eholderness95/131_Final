        "message": "I am one of the admins of a Secret Group.  One of our members took herself off because of serious health reasons and wasn't keeping up with the Group.  Now she would like to be put back in the group, but when I tried to reinstate her, it wouldn't let me ... I get this message:  \"You can't add an old member of the group who hasn't requested to join the group again\".  She has tried to find the group so she can request to re-join the group, but it doesn't come up in search because it is secret.  Can you help?"
