        "message": "OMG. People here are going crazy on WHO Facebook should be praying for instead.  War happens in countries that are expected and is talked about on the news media DAILY!!!  BUT NO ONE SEEMS TO WATCH IT.  I pray for every single one of those innocent people!!  However, I rarely pray for France, because France is NOT a war zone so to have terrorist attack it, it is surprising to everyone here in America and all other free country. \nSo yes, we are praying for France today. Stop trying to make your war bigger than others. No matter what it is, it is the same. Innocent people die!! #PrayForParis"
