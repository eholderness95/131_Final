Or do you only see European/American country(ies) news in your news feed? Maybe, if you diversified your company someone could alert you to the terrorism that took place in Nigeria. I'm going to help you out since y'all wayyyy late. This is the flag \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec. Maybe you could get a special project team together, you know, so you could at least pretend like there's equity in your concern regarding global events of devastation."
