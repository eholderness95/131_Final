But what about a flag overlay with the American flag in memory of the victims  in San Bernardino? Is FB that liberal that you spit in the faces of the people who give you the freedom to be so liberal? Shame on you Mark Zuckerberg, your 49 million don't mean nothing if you have this kind of attitude towards the country that made it possible for you to become that rich."
