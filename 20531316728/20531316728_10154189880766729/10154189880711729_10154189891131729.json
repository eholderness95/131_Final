And I don't blame you guys for what you are saying because if I were you I would have probably believed what I watch on tv too... But sadly,You literally have no idea what we go through every day to survive. You are living in your house knowing that no one will come and kick you out of it for no reason, but here, in any second, Israeli occupation forces will come and knock your house down just because they thought they should do so.any moment, you might hear the news of your brothers death while he was playing football or sisters while she's coming back from school.. And if you want to move from a place to another you have to go through tens of barriers and check points that you get humiliated at and surround the city from all directions.  And we can't even go to the beach that is 1 hour away from us.. But Israelis can come to our cities whenever they want.. Do you think that's fair? And about Hamas, I honestly have no idea what you are talking about but ever since a peace treaty is made, Israel changes its ministers or idk what they are called and the treaty is cancelled. So you see... \nAnd do you know that 80 innocent people, between 11-25 years old,  were shot by Israeli occupation forces just within the last month and yesterday night 3 houses were bombed... Like what would a 11 year old do? Don't they have the right to live too?"
