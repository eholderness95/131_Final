Which inadvertently has nothing to do with the attacks in France (unless the terrorists were Palestinian radicals). So to all the people here complaining that \"Palestine\", Syria and other known terrorist occupied areas aren't getting attention, stop....because they are getting plenty attention in the media. In many shapes and forms. Stop blaming the people at Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg for the worlds problems."

Their land is occupied heavily by Hamas who is consistently bombing Israel, they hide in Palestinian schools and hospitals, so when the Israelis retaliate against the bombers, innocent lives are victim. It's so sick. Also, Palestinian leaders are on the record of condoning VIOLENCE. Israel has been consistently and unfairly having to DEFEND themselves for almost 70 years. They were granted statehood but the surrounding countries refused to accept it. It's fact that they needed a place to live in which they're willing to defend.... don't call me a racist, I'm against violence period."
