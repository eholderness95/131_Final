        "message": "I am very disappointed that I cannot change my last name after my recent marriage. I've never had a problem before with changing my name and now all of a sudden you won't allow my name change. Since I'm changing my name last name from Peters to Miller, I'm assuming the hangup is coming from my first name. My given name is indeed Rainbow, from the very moment I was born,  and the fact that you want me to prove it to you with a government issued ID is outrageous! You are not my banking institution or government office, so why should I have to do this??? And before you give me the \"our policy states\" line I want you to know that I've read your policies. But  never has my first name ever been a problem since joining Facebook in 2008. You all just keep coming up with completely asinine policies and making ridiculous changes all the time. This is supposed to be a fun place for people to share with the world, but you are making it harder and harder for people to share and to see what they want to see."
