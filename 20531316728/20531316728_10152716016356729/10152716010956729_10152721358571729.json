Despite my best efforts and Facebook's non-existent customer support, I've made no progress and my father is the only person that seems to be locked out is his own account. This lack of regard for #customer #service is appalling. I'll be making the switch to GooglePLUS if this doesn't get resolved soon. Facebook is kind of lame anyway. #timewaster #fbsucks #newmyspace"
