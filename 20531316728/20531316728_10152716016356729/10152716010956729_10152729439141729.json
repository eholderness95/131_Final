        "message": "Facebook my daughter passed away last year and I would like to remove her account because it bothers me a lot when I get on here and see some of the things people write and put on her facebook page. I did know her account password but when I went on there to delete it, it  was the wrong password. I tried everything to recover the password. Then it came to my attention that one of her friends was running it and she wouldn't give me the password. So I'm asking you to shut it down for me. My daughter was fifteen and I have the right to have it shut down.Will you please get in contact with me and let me know what to do about this...Thank You Very Much.. Wanda Pittman"
