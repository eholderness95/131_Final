        "message": "A good friend of mine is having trouble with a STALKER / HACKER.  They are sending FB Messages and communication thru Messenger to all of his Friends & Friends/Friends. Does FB have a way to deal with these people?  I checked and this individual has about 15 FB Accounts with different or no profile photo.  He prides himself as a HACKER belonging to a group called ANNONYMOUS. Just after my friend got the first message from this person, my friend got a phone call on his land-line from someone who called herself \"Antoinette\" who said \"YOU ARE BEING WATCHED ON FACEBOOK\"  What is going on ???  What can he do ??? other than CLOSE his FB account ?????"
