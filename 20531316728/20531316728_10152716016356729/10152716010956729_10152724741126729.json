        "message": "Why have you removed the BikersUnited Relief Team page? These folks are great people who help so many across this country in disasters. Folks who give up their own time, money, leave their families behind, and go into disaster areas with huge hearts to stand up for whats right and give the people directly the donations and things they collect IN THEIR HANDS! Not like the big orgs who make MILLIONS off the people and use their tragedy to profit! These folks make nothing. Answer them! They are all over here commenting! Why would you cripple their relief efforts and hurt families?"
