She was subsequently harassed to delete it by the other page owners who started the new page that was identical to hers (called \"Socrates Leiden\" https://www.facebook.com/Socrates.Leiden/?fref=ts). Now her page has been deleted for no reason without any warning due to \"copyright infringement\" even though she was the person who started the chapter! They are a copyright infringement of her page and she is very upset with Facebook! Please delete their page and bring her page back."

You want to capitalize the first letter in facebook here when it comes to your corporate facebook page , but your logo is a always a lowercase letter. Important words should always start with a capital letter. Where did you guys go to freakin' school at??? You guys can't have it both ways. Either the word facebook is capitalized or it's lowercase. & what is it with saying facebook is 2 words in regards to & when posting the abbreviation \"FB\" ? facebook is one word. Not two words to be eligible to abbreviate it...."
