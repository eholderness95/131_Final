        "message": "Happy birthday.......Not great on all this tech stuff......but find fb easy.  Great to connect with friends I haven't heard from in years.  I can find most of the male friends I knew in school (I'm 57), but how do I find those female friends I lost contact with years ago?  Would it be possible for women, signing up to fb to have the option  of adding their birth surnames ie. Gemma Broughton nee Maguire."
