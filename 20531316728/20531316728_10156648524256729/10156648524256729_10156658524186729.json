        "message": "I am very upset that all it takes is one tap for us to like something or \"interested\" in an event. I accidently clicked interested while scrolling down a page on the phone and now it will show up that i was interested in an event. Please put verification for facebook mobile on interested becsause it is bringing shame to me when I am using Facebook.  Otherwise I enjoy facebook a lot.Thank you very much."
