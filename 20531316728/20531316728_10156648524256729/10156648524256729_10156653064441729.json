        "message": "\u2747\ufe0f\ud83d\ude01 I really enjoy my Facebook. I am not even interested in any other places like twitter or google. Even when problems occur I am confident Facebook will eventually fix the problem. Right now I am REALLY into live video stream. I'm not sure if this classifies as a problem but when I go to the live stream video page and accidentally hit the scroll wheel (which will enlarge or shrink he map) as I search the map it severely hangs or crashes the page. Is there someway I can disable the wheel on the mouse so this does not happen (?) I usually just leave the page and then return but if there was a way to prevent this from happening it would be nice. \ud83d\ude01\u2747\ufe0f"
