I know this, because I asked a few friends when some 3 or 4 posts of mine got no interaction in succession and all of them said they never saw my posts. What is up and can I expect a response on this issue? \n\nToo many weird things happening on Facebook of late. There's another issue I'm massively upset about, but I've messaged and send so many reports to the support team about that (yet to hear anything back as usual though)."
