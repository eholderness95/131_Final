We've determined that you may have used a feature in a way that could be considered abusive, even if you didn't mean to. This could include sharing to too many places, too quickly. If you think you may have been blocked by mistake, you can file an appeal here: http://bit.ly/2yLJDAq. Learn more: http://bit.ly/2z6m0Dn. -Tenaya"
