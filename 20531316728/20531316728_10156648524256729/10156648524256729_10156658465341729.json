        "message": "I have been trying to reach you guys for two days. My real account was compromised and so was my email I used to get into that account, I had to make a second account to report my personal account and now my personal account was disabled. There seems to be no way for me to get my personal pictures back now. I keep getting redirected to the help center, but it doesnt give me any answers. I even messeged you directly and havent had anyone respond to me. All I want is to get my account back, but I have no way of getting into the account or email I used for facebook. Please help me. I sent in my id but I have no idea how you will reach me if I cant get into the email for the account. So far the customer service for facebook is the worst I've ever seen. Help me change my opinion and help me get my account back."
