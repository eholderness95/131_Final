        "message": "22 mins Dear Facebook, I don't understand why the company TOMORROWSTUFF is allowed to stay on FB. I have already reported this to ya'll. If you read their comments of customers on that page you will see NO ONE receives anything they order. But they take your money from your Credit Card. Please read the comments and it would be obvious to any one that they are SCAMMERS.\u00b7 \nI want to let ya'll know that there is a company advertising and selling finger monkey's or called fingerlings. The company is TOMORROWSTUFF. I ordered 2 finger monkey's on Sept 11, 2017. I was checking the tracking on the monkey's i ordered. It said the package was in my mailbox. Well, I didn't get my monkeys. I got a plastic letter size envelope with an unsigned Christmas card inside. The envelope had the tracking number on it that belongs to the monkeys I ordered. Christmas card, no monkeys. And yes of course they took my $53.85. Before you order from someplace PLEASE read comments on their page before you order. I would have saved myself a world of pain. If you look on the Tomorrowstuff FB page and read their comments you will find NO ONE receives what they ordered from this company. I have reported them PayPal. This company is nothing but a scam. Don't take my word for it read the comments from their very upset customers that receive nothing they order. PLEASE TO DO ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE SCAMMERS AND YOU WON'T GET WHAT YOU ORDERED."
