How exactly do you know who or what i find most important? I already miss posts from my friends because my timeline is constantly defaulting back to Top Stories instead of being in chronological order like i want it. I don't understand why anyone would think this is a good idea. There are many options in place to keep things off our notifications and timeline if we don't want them there. How can Facebook tell me what I want to see??? Its a terrible idea and very irritating !!!"
