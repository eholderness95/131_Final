        "message": "HELLO FB..So many of us are having a problem sharing our post, they are deleted withing seconds once we posted. Needless to say we are fuming mad, because this is the whole purpose of FB, and I posted a picture of angels yesterday and that was deleted as well, so it's anything offensive, but none of us received any warning, msg, or comment from FB regarding this action. I f by some chance it is not FB doing this, we need to find out what is causing it, and it needs to stop. We talk to people all over the country, and the word spread fast, a couple news stations have reported on this, so it doesn't seem to be isolated. whatever it is, it needs your attention , now, please"
