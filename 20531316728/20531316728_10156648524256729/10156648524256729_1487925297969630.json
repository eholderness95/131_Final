When you made this claim in taking over my newsfeed, I started using notifications to make sure I saw everything that I am interested in. Now you have taken over my notifications feed. Can I please keep my notifications in TIME order and not reordered based on what you think I want to see first?"

Top Stories is the result of our findings, which is why it is the default. We know that some people prefer the Most Recent view, so we've kept this option available.
