But now I know I did something wrong that's why my ID is disabled. I read all Facebook policy. Next time it won't happen. This ID was very important to me. I do some money working job. I have to contract with my dealer so soon.\n\nSo, It'll be great if Facebook give me another chance to prove my self. thank you Facebook."
