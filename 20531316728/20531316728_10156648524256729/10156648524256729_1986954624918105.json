I have \"new\" and had a reply to my comment 29 minutes ago there at the top,then 6 comments on DIFFERENT posts were in the \"earlier\" and they were NEWER than the 29 minutes ago reply. It makes NO sense, and is making me miss comments etc. Why do you implement things that make no sense and not even ask us or let us choose to keep our old settings? Stop it."
