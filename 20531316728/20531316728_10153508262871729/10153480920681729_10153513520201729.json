If you are in the affected area, you will get a Facebook notification, see an alert at the top of your News Feed and receive an SMS from Facebook (if you have SMS enabled), asking if you are safe. Clicking on any of these messages will take you to Safety Check where you can mark yourself safe and check on others. In addition, you will see a bookmark on Facebook that takes you directly to the Safety Check. -Hailey"
