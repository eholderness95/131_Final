He made it and indulged in his first love and made a hobby out of it.  He raises some of the finest thoroughbreds in Canada and has about 200 mares in his stables.  He's lived his dream.  His only problem now at age 64 is the cancer that has attacked his body and now his wonderful wife has cancer too.  It just doesn't seem to be fair for these two people who worked their butts off has to end their life like this."
