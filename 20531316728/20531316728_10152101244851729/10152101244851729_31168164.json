        "message": "Ok let's get it right: Mark Zuckerberg invented facebook (yes we know with all the complications about who invented it and blah blah blah), connected 1/6 of the world (including me with my family and friends between Italy and Australia) and now is trying, with other people's help, to help the rest of the world to get the internet, not facebook, but the INTERNET and they are still wrong because people should be fed before. Why don't we do this: all of you haters stop using the internet which is useless (oh by the way I'm a web designer and developer and without this useless and horrible thing I couldn't feed my family) and with the money that you use to pay the bill you make a monthly donation to the 3rd world countries and buy food. Pretty sure they'll appreciate it.\n\nAnyway well done Internet.org keep going and if you need to involve volunteers we are all on FB waiting to help!!!!"
