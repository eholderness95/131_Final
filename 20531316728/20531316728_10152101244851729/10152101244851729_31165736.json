This partnership is simply trying to acknowledge another less-recognized thing that people in need are lacking. I'm sure that the companies making up this partnership support those other causes you listed. But these are companies that are huge in information and technology, so it makes sense for them to recognize a technology-based cause and want to use their field to help people."

You see the internet allows you to have access to endless information and can teach so much. Just because most people spend time looking up useless things on the internet, others use it to help grow their every day lives. So getting the internet to 2/3 of the world might not be the best cause but it is still a noble cause. Its like sending some one a book of endless information not just how to fish but almost how to do everything including survive"
