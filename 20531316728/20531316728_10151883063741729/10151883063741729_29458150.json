Many people write on various sites, they are looking for new users to the term \"add me\" and then have nothing better to do than the people who they really adden to log in to Facebook as harassment. Whereupon Facebook threatens to users to terminate their account. What madness. This happened to myself and many friends. It's really pure horror."
