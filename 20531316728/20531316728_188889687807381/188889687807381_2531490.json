        "message": "This guy was watching TV as his wife was out cutting the grass during the hot summer. He finally worked up the energy to go out and ask his wife what was for supper.\n\nWell, his missus was quite irritated about him sitting in the air conditioned house all day while she did all the work, so she scolded him. \"I can't believe you're aking me about supper right now! Imagine I'm out of town, go inside and figure dinner out yourself.\"\n\nSo he went back in the house and fixed himself a big steak, with potatoes, garlic bread and tall glass of iced tea.\n\nThe wife finally walked in about the time he was finishing up and asked him, \"You fixed something to eat? So where is mine?\"\n\n\"Huh? I thought you were out of town"
