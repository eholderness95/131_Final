Could you please say something in trending like \"see who just won in the first semi-final at the Australian Open...click on the \"sports\" icon right now....can you tell I'm a tennis fan.  I will say THANK YOU for responding this time....I know i'm just a little fish in your ocean but so glad someone is reading this...Please see if you could not do the spoiler...thanks again, from a loyal senior citizen Facebook follower."
