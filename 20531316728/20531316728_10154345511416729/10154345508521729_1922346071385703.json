This isn't funny and your articles and links that you send to me not helpful. Because you have to do something not sent links. I was reported because of name or something like that. Then I read an article about how you can name yourself on facebook. But I didn't do something wrong. My first name is Gerda and Sim just a nickname but everyone nows that. Please do something."
