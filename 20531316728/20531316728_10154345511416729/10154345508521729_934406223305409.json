Me and my team are facing an issue with fake accounts under our client company name ( more than 100 profiles and pages). My client told me that customers often get confused and they get directed to the wrong FB page instead of the genuine account(Some of these pages don't seem to be having an admin anymore) and they want me to shut down all those accounts that are using company name, logo and content. \nIs there a way that Facebook could either combine these pages or completely shut them down. \nI tried with reports, but there are so many accounts I just cant do it manually. Could you give me e-mail adress of Facebook employee who could solve those issues.\nThank you in advance. \nBest regards"
