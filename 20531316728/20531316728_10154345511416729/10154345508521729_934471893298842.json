I went to the page and it has done that to so many others too? Who are they? What's with this scam, spam crap? The link that they used claiming wrongdoing is  a comment I made about from Family Feud 2 the game. I mentioned how something is wrong with the game. This is not the first time this has happened. Should I reset my password? Should I delete the game?"

Then I go to get on Christmas Eve day I think and I guess you all temporarily froze my because you got a reading of an attempted log in from Columbus. (I said it wasn't me.) It all started from that BS block and a link that was used was only me askin why the Family Feud 2 game wasn't working. Btw I tried to search that weird Facebook with the squiggly above the e...nothing. They appeared in my notifications log."
