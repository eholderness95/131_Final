I have an album that I often upload a few pictures here and there each week and I'd sure love for people who go to the album to be able to see my latest photos rather than the ones I posted three years ago first.  =(  Any chance we could get a little toggle switch for that on our personal pages?"

I'm amazed that this is not even an automatic to begin with but I think if they surveyed all of FB, they'd find out how many people would LOVE to have it set up that way - where the latest upload always goes to the top of the album so it's the first one seen when someone looks at the album.  Just like the timeline photos..."
