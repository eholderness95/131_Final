You disabled the account of my Daughter, Farah, saying she wasn't legal enough and she's under 13. It wasn't her that changed the account settings, it was her little brother who took her phone by mistake and changed the birthday's settings. I would like from you to give her the account back seeing as her birthday's settings were 25/11/1992 not 2002."
