        "message": "Pls facebook bring back my account .. Facebook.com/julquen.montegil.7 montesjilia888@gmail.com ... My account was not a dummy account and it's my personal account even if my name was name of a celebrity loveteam, my name was JulQuen MonteGil .., it's JulQuen MonteGil because i really really die hard fan of them and if someone ask me if i'm JulQuen or Julia Montes or Enrique Gil (They are a celebrities loveteam here in Philippines) I just tell them that i'm just a fan. Please I can change my name or other information in my account into real, because that's account was very important to me, in that account only I feel happy because I have many friends in that account a JulQuen fans and Swifties and also I belongs in many groups in that and that group was so important to me, that group I can tell my family. And sad to say some of my group was secret so I cannot join to them if used other account. Please bring back may account it's not fake account and i'm not impersonating someone. It's very important to me it's just my account that I was used everyday and my other account that is real is the one I only use for school's need like uploading some files for assignment in my school and almost once a month I used it because this JulQuen MonteGil is my personal account. It's so hard to make a new account that can also like my JulQuen MonteGil account like my friends, groups, status, important messages, in that account. Oh my God please bring it back i'm so depressed now about what happen in my account Please facebook I make sure I change it into real and real information. Everyday and night I cry because of what happen. :'( :'( :'( :'(  ."
