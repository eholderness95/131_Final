I'd prefer to be able to block others from tagging me in the first place.\n\nIdeally, I could either selectively block individuals from being able to tag me (like, say, my brother who keeps tagging me in 30 pictures a day, despite multiple requests to stop), or block anyone from tagging me at all.\n\nAs it stands, either I have to unfriend/block someone, or sift through dozens of tags per day. Neither is a palatable option."
