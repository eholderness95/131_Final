        "message": "This little tutorial is WRONG! You don't go to the bottom of the pic, you go to the top right corner of the post. Click on the little arrow and a drop down menu appears. You will then see an option to untag yourself. Also, in the INCORRECT tutorial, the 3 dots at the bottom of the photo are shown horizontal when, in fact, they are VERTICAL. To the makers of the incorrect tutorial, please refrain from making tutorials in the future. Thanks."
