Tags from people you're not friends with may appear in your Timeline review, where you can decide if you want to allow them on your Timeline. Remember, posts you choose not to allow on your Timeline may appear in News Feed and elsewhere on Facebook. If you don't like something you're tagged in, you can remove the tag or ask the person who tagged you to remove the post. -Hailey"
