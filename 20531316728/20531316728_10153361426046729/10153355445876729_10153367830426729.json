Other than that i only use it for the science and world wide propagandas.\nBut when i am forced to change my password once because of my account being hacked by a page i never clicked on nor was ever related too. Then later being forced to verify my identity just so i can change my password again in the same day. Its obnoxious and stupid. Being hacked is not the sites fault, but when i have to deal with a stupid system i am not satisfied"
