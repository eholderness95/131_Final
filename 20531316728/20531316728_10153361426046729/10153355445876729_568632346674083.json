        "message": "I need to know how to add someone back on Facebook.  It's my brother, Eddie Gilliam from Covington, TN.  I blocked him because he hurt my feelings.  I got over being hurt and tried to add him back and couldn't.  His picture doesn't even come up.  But, he still has me as a friend but can't send me anything.  He's tried added me back as a friend but it does take it!  Please help.  Also, I deleted a friend while I was sleep walking.  Now I cannot add her back.  Her name is Samantha Bingeman and she lives in\nStockton, CA.  We've been friends for 55 years!!!"

If you want to become friends with this person again, you'll need to send them a new friend request. -Jessica"
