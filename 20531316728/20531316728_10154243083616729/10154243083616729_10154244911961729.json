        "message": "Thanks for helping us remember. I've always kind of used FB as a journal. Key points/moments in my life. I was horrible at writing in daily journals in school when they made you do it! I love the memories feature you added. It's so great to see what happened each day a year or so many ago. I've used it to watch my kids grow and stay in touch with friends I haven't seen in years. Thank you for making such an awesome venue for doing so."

I am able to be in touch with my 87 year old cousin to my Father through FB. I even found my old roommate,  who had moved away in 1984. We have gotten together once already and are planning a reunion of old housemates!  I love FB!"
