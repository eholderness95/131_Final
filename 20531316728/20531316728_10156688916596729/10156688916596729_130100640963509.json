        "message": "I need assistance with the Facebook Martketplace. The app on my phone does not have the icon for marketplace. I now have the icon on the left side of my screen on my computer, but it only take me to the page that says \"Content is not available.\" I've asked numerous times for help from support and get the generic response that marketplace isn't available to everyone right now. Why is that? Some real answers and help would be greatly appreciated."
