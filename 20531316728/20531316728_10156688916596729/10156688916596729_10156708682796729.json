        "message": "One of the Groups I admin for was recently deleted without my knowledge, and the other admins did not delete it either. We believe it is because we have a Wikia link in the description of the page, because when I try to post a direct link to the group on Facebook, it gives me an alert about an \"unsafe link\" and refers to the Wikia link. None of the admins were notified about the problematic link, and now we don't have the ability to remove it as the group was removed. I've already sent in a support case with a screenshot, but it's kind of urgent that the group is restored in one way or another, especially since there is six years plus worth of content there that isn't posted or saved elsewhere. Is it possible I can get assistance with this?"
