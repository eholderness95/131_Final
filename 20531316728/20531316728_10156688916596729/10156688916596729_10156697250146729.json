        "message": "I would say yes. I like to see a selfie in the profile pic. Just helps to see a face when someone is commenting. Instead of some random picture of rocks or something. On a side not I think the way you review videos before blocking should be reviewed. Review the comments in a live stream before you block someone from going live again. A lot of the ones reporting are just people out there looking to make trouble for anyone they can. Also I think you should be told who reported you or at least given the ability to perma block that individual. There should be no reason for the same person to report an individual twice, once reported they should be instantly blocked so they can not harass that person."
