        "message": "I am about to give up on advertising on FB for good. I am no longer allowed to choose a previously used audience. I have several specifically targeted audiences that have been very effective for me. Whenever I choose one I get the following error \"Your audience selection is too specific for your ads to be shown. Try making it broader.\". My targeted audiences were 10K +/-. For some reason FB wants to water down my ad buy by including people that are never gonna spend a dime with me.  I cant even use the audience from my last ad campaign that started less than 30 days ago! WTH?"
