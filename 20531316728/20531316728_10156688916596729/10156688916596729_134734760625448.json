I reported a bunch of horrible videos involving underage content, troublesome material, violent and unacceptable content and you said it was fine.  I know it isn\u2019t fine and I think you have an algorithm running this and not a person.  I have no choice but to report it.\n\nIn the past these videos were removed.  \ud83d\ude21. Why not today?\n\nAnd as a stockholder I\u2019m really irritated by this.  You are going to ruin your brand not to mention expose children and victims to a lot of triggering and offensive things.\n\nPlease pay attention to flagged material."
