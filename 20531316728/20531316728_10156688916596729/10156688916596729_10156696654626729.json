It's their ability to actually read bug reports, and actually fix those bugs, and do so without waiting for months on end only to make it worse and screw up ten more things. \n\nJust like right now. I suddenly cannot use messenger anymore, at all, after having multiple issues leading up to this. Yet, every single report I've made about it has been completely ignored, and I know this report will go ignored as well."
