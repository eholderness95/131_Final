        "message": "I've filed complaints for an intellectual property/trademark violation for my business page through the Help Center and every resource I can find on Facebook, however I have not gotten any reply. I am imminently retaining an attorney on the matter (to deal with the individual in violation of my trademark) and prior to doing so I would like to be in touch with the Facebook legal department so I may have the attorney send a physical copy of the demand letter as well as the cease and desist once they have been composed and sent to the offending party. How can I get this information? \n\nThank you."
