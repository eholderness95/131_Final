        "message": "I'd like to know why my Facebook ad account has been disabled and for how long. I filled out the appeal form and sent my DL, and you told me that the account was reactivated, but when I went to set up a promotion it was still flagged. How long does it take?. You already notified me that it was reactivated. What is the real issue here? I had been using Facebook ads to promote my products for 2 years already. What is the content you flagged? All I sell is books and jewelry, so you had better get on the ball or I will file a case against you with the FTC."
