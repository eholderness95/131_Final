I received an email saying that you are REMOVING a page I manage because a Vimeo was reported as violating copyright. \nI have NO idea what they are talking about, not sure about any Vimeo, so I believe this is a hoax, but how can I be sure? \n\nI sure don't want to lose my page! Do you have an address I can forward said email?"
