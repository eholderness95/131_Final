        "message": "nice to kno u guys are allowing someone to have a page with a video on it that is causing people to message another person and bully them...\"Words from a Personal Trainer\" is the page, and they have a video of my brother from 8 years ago from Scared Straight (A&E show)...People are calling him names, messaging him and bullying him...I went to get the person with the page to take the video down and he wont...So, if Facebook is not going to take it down, we will be forced to involve the police for a cyber-bullying crime that Facebook is not taking care of...Selfies are much more important then cyber bullying"
