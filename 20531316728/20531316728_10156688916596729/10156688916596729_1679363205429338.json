How do I report patent infringement? I respectfully reached out to the person with a cease a desist with no response and the post was not removed. There have been may shares. A purchaser of my product commented on the page that they knew the inventor and had purchased it before and liked it - it was deleted immediately. (again, a respectful post). Help, please!"
