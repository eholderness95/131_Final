        "message": "I am very mad at Facebook.   Over the past 1-2 years I go on their page messaging one suggestion.  I have many thousands of photos and cant get to the ones I want as I am inundated with pictures I want GONE.  The Facebook messaging says they will \"respond\" immediately if you message them.  I have never gotten a reply!!! This indicates to me that they could care less about my question or my attempt to give a suggestion that would make Facebook work for me.  I never put photos in albums and have to scroll forever to find the pictures I want or need of my family.  Can anyone help me????  or at least respond to my inquiry????  I imagine it wouldn't take much for you to give us the option to delete multiple photos.  Thank you"
