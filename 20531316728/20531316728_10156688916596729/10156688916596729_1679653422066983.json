Doesn't seem to be helping me. I need to be reinstated to messaging to be able to do my \"job\" for the groups I belong to.\n\nI'm getting a \"this feature not available\" when I try to send messages. Please correct the problem and get it turned on for me again. I don't send spam or garbage to anyone. Most of what I send are messages to people that want to become members of groups I am a moderator in. Necessary messages! Turn it back on for me now. \nYou can verify this by contacting Lenora Porzillo, the owner of the groups."

Being a moderator that reviews people that want to join the groups, but didn't bother to answer the questions that are asked, means we send them a message to remind them they have to answer the questions. That's how we handle people that want to join. So the messages are needed to communicate with the people. We can't call them on the phone or let them know why they aren't being accepted any other way. And we aren't so rude as to just delete their request without sending the messages. You people don't bother to communicate with us to see why we are doing what we are doing, you just turn off our ability to operate in the manner we feel is needed. You provided the tool for contacting others and then want to dictate how we use it. That is a bit \"big brother\" don't you think. I want my message ability returned now. Operating within the groups requires that ability. I really don't think it's your call to do this."
