We recommend reaching out to the current or previous admin to have them grant you access by assigning you an admin role. You can find the steps to adding an admin to a Page in our Help Center: http://bit.ly/2icYMBr. If you can't contact the previous admin, or if the Page no longer has an admin, you will not be able to regain access to the Page. You can find information about creating a new Page here:https://www.facebook.com/help/104002523024878. -Tenaya"
