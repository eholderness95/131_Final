How can I use this link on my old account when I cannot even get into it....the message on the screen is \"SECURITY CHECK\" then it has a Red Caution symbol saying \"this account isn't eligible for this process.\" Because it shows where that to confirm your identity with a text, but I got an email saying that is was removed...but I am wondering if it is because I used my new phone number for this account.  But it still wasn't working to get codes.  Do you understand what I am explaining?"
