And you are all at Facebook indiscriminately wrongfully branding as \"spam\" ANY CONTENT or any article--even cat photos, on my Timeline, and no matter what I do, you have singled me out, and launched on a campaign to make my Facebook experience unusable and CENSORED by using the pretext of SPAM as a way to cowardly silence my voice and the rights you have preserved for others to enjoy.
