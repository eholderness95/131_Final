If you don't see translations options for comments written in another language, make sure that translation options are turned on for that language. You can learn how here: http://bit.ly/2h9vNNX. If your translation options are turned on and you are still not seeing the option to translate a comment, please report it to us here: http://bit.ly/2hbLJiC. -Elizabeth"
