        "message": "I can\u2019t log into my Facebook for about 3 weeks now. I have emailed and messaged them countless times and I get no response. I understand that they get a lot of those but it\u2019s frustrating because no matter what I do to try to log in, it doesn\u2019t let me. I have a business and I manage it through Facebook and I\u2019ve lost clients because I have no access to my account. I can\u2019t do sales. I\u2019ve  done all the steps they have asked me to go through, sent my ID like they asked me to do and nothing changed. I need them to try to help recover my account or shut it down for good i don\u2019t want to see my Facebook account float on the internet!! Please help me resolve this issue. Thank you."

I cannot do anything when it is asking for a code. Technically I just verified that I am the owner of that other account because I managed to reset the password just now, its just that I can't receive any codes so PLEASE CAN ANYONE HELP."
