        "message": "To be honest .. I've found out that facebook company is not good enough and doesn't take care of customers as it should be .. \nmy account facebook still has a defect and problems for 3 days and no one could fix it in this famous company or try to message me for telling me that they will, at least . \nIt's not a respectable way to behave with your customers, by ignoring and neglecting problems customers are facing .\nFor the last time I ask you to fix problems which has happened in my facebook account and return it back like before .\nPlease take a look to my home page of my facebook account and you will know what about i'm talking ..\n my account is (https://www.facebook.com/walidherat?ref=tn_tnmn ) . it's the same account which i've sent this comment from it ."
