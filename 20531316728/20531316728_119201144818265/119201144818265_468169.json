        "message": "Hello managers of Facebook! I have a question for you, dunno where else to post it. The new profile that you made, where can my friends see my links that I have been posting since I opened my account on FB? The old profile has the option LINKS on my wall, it is located like this: Wall - Info - Photos - LINKS etc. so any of my friends can see all my links that I have shared, and as I noticed the new profile doesn't have it. I like the new profile but I didn't switch yet. Just because of that, the links issue. I'd like you to post an answer about my question. Thank you!"
