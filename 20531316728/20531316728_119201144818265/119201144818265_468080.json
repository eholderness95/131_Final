Specifically, we want the company to:\n\n\n\n\n* Commit to stop using polluting coal power,\n\n\n\n* Use its purchasing power to choose only clean, renewable sources of electricity,\n\n\n\n* Advocate for strong climate and energy policy changes at the local, national and international level to ensure that as the IT industry's energy demand increases, so does the supply of renewable energy,\n\n\n\n* Share this information publicly on its website so its millions of users know the company is a climate leader."
