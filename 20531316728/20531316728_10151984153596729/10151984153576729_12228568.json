        "message": "Being human and loving one another beyond judgement connects us. Pride in one's sexual orientation, religion, politics ect... only separates us and perpetuates hate towards the opposition every time. Look at you people turning this fb post into a religious debate! Just love one another for who they are and get off your high horse and stop feeding into man-made ideologies. Ridiculous."
