While we encourage you to challenge ideas, institutions, events, and practices, we do not permit individuals or groups to attack others based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or medical condition.\n\nIn taking a position, it has come directly after certain Facebook users based on at least TWO of these criteria.  To make matters worse, even if the development team could justify that it was not an attack per se, the door was opened, via this post, to enable (or even encourage) others to violate these terms and conditions.  If nothing else, they've taken a side in this discourse in an irresponsible manner."
