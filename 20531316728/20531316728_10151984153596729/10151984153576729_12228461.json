Most had ancestors that did not agree with interracial marriage and integration of the races.  Today we look back at that time as ridiculous and ill-informed.  Future generations will look at comments like these the same way.  Plus, I didn't read anything in this post about supporting gay marriage-just that the majority of folks are in some way connected to a gay person.  And that is just a statistical fact, not a political opinion."

And if you do want to tie gay sex into the equation, and forgive me if I get too graphic here, I suppose married couples should only perform sexual acts that would lead to a child?

So every religion and every religious person is allowed to believe what they want, but we can't legislate from these beliefs.  And as an aside, I hope I have not come across confused, depressed, or angry, as you say gays usually are, because I certainly don't feel any of those things right now.  And since you wanted to go personal, I certainly have not abandoned God.  I fully believe in him, and try to practice what He has taught me, which is to love and respect my fellow humans, even those who don't agree with me.  So I won't throw insults, hate on others, or turn negative.  I will just live every day the way I believe He wants me to."

Because, like it or not, there are many government benefits to marriage (tax breaks, spousal health benefits, estate taxes, and the list goes on).  The government has gotten into the marriage business, so they have to treat all of their citizens equally.  I'm actually all for any church and religion that does not believe in same-sex marriage to be allowed not to recognize them or perform them.  That should absolutely be a part of their religious freedom guaranteed in this country.  But the GOVERNMENT should recognize these marriages and allow access to all the benefits and responsibilities it entails.  And as for me stopping being gay-sorry, my man, no can do.  I gotta live the life God gave me, and this is the one I've got.  As an aside, I do appreciate the dialogue.  Living in a large liberal city (the cesspool of hell, as many conservatives would believe lol), I love being able to understand the other side.  We don't have to agree (it seems that we don't) but I appreciate the civil conversation back and forth-it hopefully enlightens us both."
