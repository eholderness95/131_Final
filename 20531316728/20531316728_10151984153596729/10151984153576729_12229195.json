        "message": "I may be one of the 70% who has a friend who is openly gay, but, I do not approve of the gay lifestyle! Therefore, I'm not one who has gay pride. \nI love my friends, I hate their lifestyle! It doesn't stop me from being their friend, however!!! \nHomosexuality is a sin. BUT, let he who has no sin cast the first stone. Sin is sin! There isn't a giant scale that weighs 1 sin differently than another. Abortion is a sin! Cursing is a sin! Lying, stealing, cheating, murder, need I go on? It's all sin, but Jesus still loves EVERYONE! He hates the sin but loves the sinner!!!"
