        "message": "So many repeated BS homophobic arguments. If you didn't know Facebook was supportive of equality, culture, and diversity before, there is an option where you don't have to have an account just like you don't have to be gay! There are many corporations such as Coca-Cola who support this as well and there is nothing wrong with that! Grow up before you screw yourself over by being on the wrong side of history. You don't want to end up being \"the sin\" in our history books now. Love and equality for all no matter what religion is according to others! <3"
