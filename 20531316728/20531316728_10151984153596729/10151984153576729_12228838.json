        "message": "It's obvious that claiming to be religious doesn't make you a good person. In fact, many of you are coming across as hypocrites. We all sin in some way yet you have the nerve to judge others. Love is love. What if we all loved instead of hate? The bible is an outdated book that not all believe in. Stop using it as your only defense. Christians divorce, commit crimes, have premarital sex but then have a judgmental opinion about 2 people being in love. Get over yourselves!!!"
