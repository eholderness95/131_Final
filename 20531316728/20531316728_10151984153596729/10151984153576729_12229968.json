I understand that gay people feel attractions to the same sex, however it is entirely possible that it is simply temptation by the enemy. You take \"pride\" in your actions so that you don't feel threatened by hostile people. Granted people against homosexuality shouldn't be hostile (but they should continue to stand up against this wrong). I'm just going to keep this short and say that people need Jesus and His Truth."

Also, many dedicated Christians they see are what the media shows them - super fanatical people who don't use logic. As a man of both science and \"religion\" I understand that the universe is governed by laws of physics and the importance of logical and critical thinking."

Many people seem to take anything that disagrees with their own views as hate. I don't hate homosexuals. I don't hate ANYBODY. In fact, I love all of my fellow human beings which is why I'm trying to show them the right way. I don't know why you don't believe in God. I believe the sure fire way to prove to someone that my God is true is by revealing a true Christian's character. This would show people how  life changing Jesus is and how He can work in people's lives. The problem is that a lot of people don't act like true Christians. To be honest, I'm far from perfect myself. I make mistakes everyday. But there was one man who never made a mistake and He wants to show you the way to an eternity of happiness alongside Him and who knows how many other people."
