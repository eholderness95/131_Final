        "message": "Facebook, do you know the statistics of users who are connected to Breast cancer survivors? To War veterans? To adopted people? To biracial/bilingual people? To vegans? All this hate back and forth is a result of focusing on one issue. What about the homeless or the hungry? I have gay friends, but I don't post a big sign on my house stating it. They're just people. And for those hateful commentators using scripture, please read John 3:5 and John 3:16, until you memorize them. ALL have sinned and come short of the glory of God, and then...He loved the world so much, that He gave His only son Jesus, to die for those sins. So that NONE should perish, but ALL could have everlasting life. God bless"
