After saying Starbucks wants to \u201cembrace diversity of all kinds,\u201d he told a \nshareholder who supports traditional marriage that he should sell his shares  and invest                          in some other company.\n\nAccording to a report by Forbes, Schultz seemed a bit intolerant of any \nStarbucks shareholders who opposed gay marriage for moral or religious reasons. \nDuring the meeting, shareholder Tom Strobhar (who founded the Corporate \nMorality Action Center) pointed out that after the company voiced its support for a referendum backing  gay marriage in Washington state, a boycott by traditional marriage \nsupporters caused a drop in sales revenue. Schultz told him \u201cYou can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another  company\u201d if he did not agree with the company\u2019s                   pro-gay marriage stand."
