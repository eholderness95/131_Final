        "message": "I find it odd how equal rights, understanding, fairness, and pride only seem to apply for those who support gay marriage. If you oppose it, you are \"hateful\" or a \"bigot\".  If it really is about fairness and equality, then those terms should not be used against people who don't support gay marriage."
