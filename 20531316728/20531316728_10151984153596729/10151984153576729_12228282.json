Having possessions isn't necessarily wrong; the things people do to have possessions could be wrong, as well as allowing those things to shape who we are. I hate nobody. I care enough to be concerned about where others souls spend eternity. Honestly, I think I care more about others' souls, then some of the people do themselves. Please, don't let false Christians cause you to hate true Christians. "
