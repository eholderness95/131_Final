        "message": "You know, that is so true.  We all have troubled times in life.  Facing challenges without those whom love you would make that a harder challenge to healing.  I'm so blessed with those whom just listened, cared & allowed me to cry on their shoulders when I was at a very low point in my life.   Thanks to all my friends whom were there for me.   I'm getting back up on my feet, getting stronger & my smile is coming back...thanks to you!!"
