        "message": "I watch from afar thru Facebook a small sliver of my friends daily lives in Idaho. Sadly it is nowhere near like being there with them. But I will take and savor all that is available to me. Criticize F.B. if you will, but I'm thankful for it's existence that allows me to stay in touch, not only in print, but in visual media. Keep the posts coming, I love seeing and hearing from you!"
