After reporting this page your team concluded there is nothing the matter and is letting this page continue there plagiarism.\n\nWhen reporting such a violation of your community policy fb does not offer an sufficient possibility to describe what's really the matter. I've also left feedback after fb denying my report for this imposter page and so far fb ignored my feedback.\n\nSince fb does not offer the right means for reporting this kind of bullying it may be obvious that it's almost impossible to get in contact with FB to explain properly in person what is going on.\n\nI don\u2019t want to give up or change the name my page, I was the first using this name and what I would like to see is that fb to force the other page to change it\u2019s name.\n\nPlease help me, the guy behind this page is driving me crazy and i\u2019m almost sick and tired of being bullied this way.\n\nCan you help me by providing me with an mail address or phone number in The Netherlands or can you get in contact with me so I can explain in person to Facebook what's really going on."
