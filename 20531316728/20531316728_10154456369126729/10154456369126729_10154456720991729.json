        "message": "yesterday i sent Facebook here a private message about a problem i am having in attempting to block someone ....i thought to do it as a private message and be polite about it....BUT.....evidently Facebook doesn't seem to appreciate my efforts in doing that,,i assume just as Facebook  never really listens to any of us but does as it wishes...,not even having any type of live customer service...ok here is my situation and perhaps someone who signs on here will have the answer since it seems that Facebook can't be bothered to assist me.....i want to BLOCK someone from posting to me...yes i did go to settings...and i did go to block....and i did type in the persons name and clicked on the one of many that came up...to block that person....i then received the usual screen advising me that if i block them, etc etc...i did click to block them...i then received a screen i have never seen before....from Facebook advising me that THIS PERSON CANNOT BE BLOCKED FOR NOW....I TRIED IT NUMEROUS TIMES LAST NIGHT AND AGAIN JUST NOW....are we suddenly not allowed to block those we care to block and only the ones that Facebook allows us to?  It also advises that perhaps i should contact this person directly myself because she may not realize that she is bothering me....If anyone reading this...that is if Facebook does not hide or delete it...has an answer for me, i would greatly appreciate it...and i do thank you in advance....BTW this person i have never 'liked' on Facebook and she, according to her page has 1,869,930 FOLLOWERS...i will gladly give you her name if interested."
