        "message": "Dear MySpace...I mean Facebook,\nI have been a devoted fan of yours for a long time but have to admit the way you've changed friend lists and other components to the site...notsomuch. Due to the recent changes and not being able to use the lists as I have for months to keep in touch with family, friends, co-workers, etc., I cannot keep in touch with people as easily without physically going to individual sites and who in the world has time for all of that? UGH!!!!!!!!! Please do not conform to or model yourself after other social networks! A return to the format that made you what you are today and a household name would be much appreciated.
