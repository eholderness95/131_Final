        "message": "I love Facebook, but I want to ask one question do you discriminate against the older worker like the rest of the companies do. Need a page on Unemployment since I live in Oklahoma and they have a deal replacing older workers with younger workers, there is a lot of lawsuits with the wage and labor board over it or not paying there employees after doing their jobs. I have been unemployed for 2 years and haven't been able to get a job since because no one wants to hire the older worker and we are experienced. They think the older people don't need a job to eat and survive and they are wrong. So while you are marketing put that out there to the companies and see what answers you get."
