        "message": "keeping in touch frequently is necessary \nto show that we still remember each other even when we're separated. \nhowever it can get pretty awkward suddenly coming up \nand saying hello, asking what they've been up to and all.\nback then that was basically the only means of catching up.\nalso, it can even be a waste of time sometimes. \n\nbut now, there are new ways in staying connected \nwithout saying a word at all;\njust by begin following each other on our pages, \nwe liking their stuffs, they liking ours back,\nwe sharing whatever they've added, they sharing ours in return, \nand the both of us get notified that we've been watching \nwhat the other party's been doing all this while, the entire time. \n\nit's especially useful for myself \nwho's the type who gets rather tensed up \nwhen i accidentally bump into someone i've not met in years \nand begin saying silly things and asking silly questions\nbecause i feel obligated to show i enjoy \nthe rare and unexpected conversations.\n\nbut now, we keep in touch like every single day in this manner.\nand it's both very educational and entertaining \nto learn more about ourselves \nby seeing what others do that we don't, \nborrowing their influences \nand implementing them into our daily lives. \n\ni begin liking things i used to never take notice of \nwhen i was a child; the same goes for them.\nwe learn from each other through facebook ^_^ \nHappy 12th Birthday Facebook!"
