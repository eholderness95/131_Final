        "message": "Facebook has given me the opportunity to speak to, see and chat with ppl I had lost contact but had always wondered about. Computers were just coming out when I was in high school, lol I'm only 47, but that was at a time where some of my generation was lost with technology and how quickly it came about. We watched things happen on the movie screen, never did I think I would actually use it. It helped rekindle, give closure, and catch up with friends far and wide. Congratulations on all of your success. Happy Friends day!"
