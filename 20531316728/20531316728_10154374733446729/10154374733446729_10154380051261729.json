        "message": "Thank you - you kids have literally changed the world. I moved from AL to WI when I was 15. I was an abused college student who married her abuser. Then got out. As you can imagine, getting \"out\" meant losing people, friends, and even my own child and others I considered family. Thanks only to you, I see my son, every day. I have friends from grade school who have reached out and said I was the first person to be nice to them in school. I've motivated people and they have motivated me. I love y'all, and appreciate you, every day. I try to keep it positive, as I believe you all do this for a positive environment, and you let me in. You are the best marketing tool I have found and I have a successful business as an artist. Salute. Cheers. Take care of yourselves. I love you."
