If you've allowed people to follow you, you can see a list of your followers by going to your profile, clicking Friends below your cover photo and then clicking Followers. If you don't have any followers, you won't see this option. Additionally, you can learn more about managing your followers here: http://bit.ly/2qtLqDT. -Jessica"
