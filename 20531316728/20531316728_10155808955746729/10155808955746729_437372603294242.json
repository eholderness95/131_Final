Every time I play a game or refresh the page it goes to top stories.. I HATE top stories...I want most recent so I can scroll down and NOT miss anything.. and I want all my friends and families posts to show up...I mean, why do you stop showing some?  Please fix this by letting us permanently choose which we want in preferences and stop switching us to the stupid top stories that does not show us everything we missed in the past several hours of being away from the computer.."

Top Stories is the result of our findings, which is why it is the default. We know that some people prefer the Most Recent view, so we've kept this option available. If you have specific thoughts you want to share, please let us know here: http://bit.ly/2qwJSco. Additionally, if you feel you\u2019re missing stories from a Page or profile you\u2019d like to see, go to the Page or profile and confirm it says Following at the top. You can also adjust your News Feed to make posts from certain Pages and profiles appear at the top by selecting the prioritize who to see first option from your News Feed preferences.
