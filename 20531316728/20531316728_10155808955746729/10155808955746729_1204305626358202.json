It's searchable within that which is nice, it has maybe 50 people in it. I also have another group that's public and open, which has maybe 300 people in it. The issue is, they're for the same club and it's prone to fragmentation / confusion, is there some way I can merge the two?"

I'd recommend notifying everyone in the group you want to stop using that you'll be using the other group going forward.
