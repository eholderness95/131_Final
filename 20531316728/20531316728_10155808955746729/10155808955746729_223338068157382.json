Can someone check on my issue that I've been waiting for response for since Wednesday ?? \n\nIs there currently an issue with Facebook Groups ? Our 1mil group has had a very low activity over the past two days and a LOT of users say they see a white screen and says \"there has been an error\". Lots of users have commented today and said they believe they are blocked from the group because they are not receiving our stories. How in the world am I to tell my 1milliom members to activate notifications when they can't even see what we post ??"
