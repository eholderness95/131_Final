Most Recent shows stories in the order they were posted, and Top Stories shows stories from people and things you interact with most at the top. We know that some people prefer the Most Recent view, so we've kept this option available. If you have specific thoughts you want to share, please let us know here: http://bit.ly/2rtAKbe. -Jessica"
