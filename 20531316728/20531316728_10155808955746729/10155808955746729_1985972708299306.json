Top Stories is the result of our findings, which is why it is the default. We know that some people prefer the Most Recent view, so we've kept this option available. If you have specific thoughts you want to share, please let us know here: http://bit.ly/2ri5a08. Additionally, if you feel you're missing stories you'd like to see or seeing stories in your News Feed that you don't want to see, use the different News Feed controls to adjust your preferences. Learn how at: http://bit.ly/2pX6vp4. -Jessica"
