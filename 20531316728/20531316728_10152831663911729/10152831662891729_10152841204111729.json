You can find more details on converting a Page here: http://on.fb.me/1jju01n Your husband will now be an admin of the Page and can access the Page through his personal account in a few easy steps. Learn how at: http://on.fb.me/1jju15j Please let me know if this helps. - Sarah"

First it says we cant use the same name, there are dashes in the name, we remove the dashes assuming that is the problem. Then it says we must pick a name that is similar. How much more similar can I get, same name no dashes. It wont let us get past  that point. We can't even sign on the personal account anymore. I know how to convert it, its your system that keeps giving me errors no matter what I do. That is what I need help with. My first comment clearly states this. Please help with this facebook system problem."
