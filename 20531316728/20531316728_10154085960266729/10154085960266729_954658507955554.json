        "message": "I just found out that I have trouble viewing 360 videos posted in facebook. It seems like the gyro or accelerometer isn't working the way it should be. I can navigate it by touching only the screen. But that's only in facebook app, it's working properly in youtube 360videos as well as all the vr cardboard apps.\n\nI'm using a Samsung Galaxy K Zoom (S5 Zoom) with an updated Android Facebook app, Kitkat.\n\nAnyone else experiencing this?"
