        "message": "Not sure if this is where I can get help. I've been trying to post photos from my iPad. I'm currently using another iPad as my original is in the shop being repaired. I've taken photos with the new IPad but Facebook is not allowing me to post self videos or pictures taken from this iPad. I went into setting and could not find anything that would help. Any help would be appreciated.   Thank you.     Jimmy Dorsey"
