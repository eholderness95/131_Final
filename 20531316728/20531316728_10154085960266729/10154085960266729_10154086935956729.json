        "message": "Since this morning I get in my e-mailbox all kinds of postings from people and brands, because I have set my \"meldingen\" for years. Normally I would get only messages in my e-mailbox when there was a reaction on a posting from me...but now I get spammed by ALL NEW postings on facebook from the people and brands that I LIKE and set MELDINGEN on. Could you please find out, what happened since today at your facebookcompagny. I assume that everybody who had switch MELDINGEN on becomes crazy and all mailboxes will be filled up with all kinds of postings. Normally I would get 1 or 2 Meldingen on my mailbox, because people reacted on my posting or I won a prize or something. Now I get in one hour 100 MELDINGEN in my mailbox. All not neccesary so please set your facebook back to what it was yesterday and the years beyond. I suppose the providers from internet and mailboxes won't be happy with facebook now. All boxes get FULL! in one day this way!"
