        "message": "I write here because it have been made too difficult to just ask some help so it takes my whole few free time that will be left after the job for money.\n\nFacebook said to me that I will get 30 euros for my ads and so I reacted. But I didn't get the code and I moved forward because I hoped that it yet will give me the code. Finally, I got my advertisement to be added and I read one post somewhere that paying now with coupons is currently not possible. I removed my add. I really hope that I will not get a bill only because Facebook promised me to give some coupons. :/ (Only exception if in real at last I get something back perhaps when I success in gaining some attention and interested ones once in my life...)\n\nDo I need to pay now? Also I still don't understand how much."
