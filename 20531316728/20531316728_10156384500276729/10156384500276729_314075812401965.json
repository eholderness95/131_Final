The fact that they can also approve my paid advert and then stop it after 2 days because \u2018there appears to be too many words\u2019 just means I\u2019ll avoid paid adverts in future.

Facebook finally approved my paid for advert - 9 days after asking for a review because they blocked it for having too many words.

I wonder how many people get charged a fortune by Facebook for paid adverts run without permission after a marketing campaign has ended. People need to be aware of the shoddy practice."
