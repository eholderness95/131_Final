I have clicked on a post of a friends from Apps-test and now it will not stop posting in my friend's feeds as if i posted it.  It is even writing a comment on the posts that I didn't write.  My friends are not able to report it because there is no option to and I cannot report it because it doesn't show up in my feed.  Please help! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
