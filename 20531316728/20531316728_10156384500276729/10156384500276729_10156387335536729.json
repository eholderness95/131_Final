        "message": "Facebook....your decision to change the algorithm so that the post with the most comments instead of the most likes was a horrible choice. That puts whatever is the most inflammatory post at the top of the thread, which just means it gets more comments. This encourages trolls since provoking outrage and upsetting people is their goal. It also means when you look at your personal thread, and now there's a new feature where you can see the top comment, you have to see something that usually immediately pisses you off. Please consider changing it. I've seen multiple posts on threads complaining about it, so I know I'm not alone in thinking this is a bad idea."
