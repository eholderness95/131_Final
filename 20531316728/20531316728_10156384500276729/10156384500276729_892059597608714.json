            "message": "Hi there. The blue verification badge lets people know that a Page or profile of public interest is authentic. We apply the blue verification badge to eligible brands, media organizations and public figures. Eligibility for the blue verification badge is based on a variety of factors, such as account completeness, policy compliance and public interest. If your account doesn't have a blue verification badge, there are other ways to help let people know that you're authentic. For example, you can link to your Facebook profile or Page from your official website, Instagram profile or Twitter account. To learn more about blue verification badges, visit our Help Center: http://bit.ly/2v0ZKJ8. Hope this helps. -Ashley"
