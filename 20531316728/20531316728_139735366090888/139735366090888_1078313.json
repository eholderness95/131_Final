They saw Jerry's corpse and they just left because they were scared. But that night they all died because of their friend. He killed the...m all for making him sleep in that house\nIf you don't send this to 11 comments you will die tonight by Jerry. Example 1:\nA man named Stewart Read this and didn't believe it. He shut off his computer and went through his day. That night while he was in bed he heard something outside of his door. He got up to look. And now he's dead.
