        "message": "This sucks. You changed it automatically without letting us know first or giving us a chance to stop it. When you make changes like this, make them OPT-IN changes, not OPT-OUT changes. A lot of users may be missing out on friends' posts they expect to be there and don't even know it. The concept is a good idea, but you gotta stop springing these changes on us. Let us choose how we want our information filtered."
