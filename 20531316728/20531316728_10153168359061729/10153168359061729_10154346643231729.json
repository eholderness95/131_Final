        "message": "Could you do some charity to get the dogs who are in kill shelters to be adopted by orphanages   in other countries and for the laws to make it that everyone can have a pet and get all the animals homes or put into places where children with special needs can come and play with the dogs and cats and people in senior housing and help organize organizations to have pet therapy dogs and rabbits and cats and other animals for children and adults to learn about and visit them in a setting like they have for kids to play with them and staff to take care of the animals and get kids to volunteer to walk and help with them and get families to adopt one or two pets. The dogs in china need help and to be saved as well as other animals and to pair off with people who will take care of them etc. To set up like sanctuaries where animals can live and people can come and take care and learn and give service to them and it works both ways the people will be happier and healthier and the animals too."
