This helps you to see more stories that interest you from friends you interact with the most. The number of comments and likes a post receives and what kind of story it is (ex: photo, video, status update) can also make it more likely to appear in your News Feed. If you feel you're missing stories you'd like to see, or seeing stories in your News Feed that you don't want to see, you can adjust your settings.
