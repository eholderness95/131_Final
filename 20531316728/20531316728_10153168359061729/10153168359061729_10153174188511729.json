        "message": "Dear Mark fb was a brilliant idea and has been amazing for keeping people in touch and sharing information. Could I ask that you overhaul your reporting facility because lately some of the most hideous stuff such as live video of murder, open lies in the form of phitoshopped pics designed to harass people, open hatred of races religions and genders and blatent threats of violence are coming back as not violating your community standards when your standards clearly state that they are. I have had and know people who have had pics of a bus reported as hate speech taken down yet the vile stuff is allowed. Could you please sort this as fb is becoming a fetid sewer and it would be a shame if everyone left it for other better controlled social networking sites. Thank you for your time."
