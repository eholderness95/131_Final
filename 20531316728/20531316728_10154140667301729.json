Look for the lightning bolt on the top right corner of some stories shared in News Feed. The lightning bolt indicates it's an Instant Article. When you tap the story, it loads ten times faster than a standard mobile web article and the reading experience is beautiful and more interactive.\n\nWe hope you love it as much as we do."
