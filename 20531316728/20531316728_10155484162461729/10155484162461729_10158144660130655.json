You can then request to claim the Page and become its admin, or merge the Page into a Page you already manage for your business: http://bit.ly/2lrT7Yp. However, if the Page is managed, you won't see the option to claim it. If this is the case, you can report the Page: http://bit.ly/2lrO0Y6. -Jessica"

I looked at all the report options and none of them fits my situation, the closest one is trademark infringement, but I don't know if I want to do that considering the page was started from a deactivated account of mine."
