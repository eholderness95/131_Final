        "message": "Facebook is the best thing to happen to my comedy and acting career. Thanks to Facebook the COMICHOOD has been a successful showcase for new and seasoned comics from all over, and it's actually made me something I never thought I'd be, a successful producer(in my 3rd year). Not to mention getting in touch with friends and family I thought I'd never see again, so once again thank you. To show my appreciation I'm giving you 8 VIP passes to the following shows@BROADWAY COMEDY CLUB, 318 w 53rd street, 9pm: April 30, May 21st, June 25th, July 23rd, and August 27th. Once again thank you so much and hope to see and meet you. One Love."
