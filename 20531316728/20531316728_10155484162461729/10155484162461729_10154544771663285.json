Here, see for yourself: \"I see absolutely no reason as to why I was blocked temporarily like this. I make a living off of promotions and recruiting new people to the company I work for. It's urgent that I am able to post in groups immediately. Also, I think it happened to due me just requesting to join too many groups for work home opportunities all at once which I had no idea there was a limit to but you definitely CAN NOT just block me like this without a warning! Please unblock ASAP. Thanks!\""
