All those pictures that you are taking - each one has a story to tell of their struggle to survive in this world.  Bless you for helping them and treating them like human beings."

His letter:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/anatolijsharij\nGood afternoon! Today I have received this message and has been blocked for 30 days. I didn't used absolutely no abusive expressions, any antisemitism and other rights violations. \nMy reply has been given two months ago at the offensive comments about me. This blocking is - an obvious mistake, and quite sorrowful. I would be extremely grateful if you could assist in the speedy solving this problem. \nI am - well-known journalist, I have more than 180,000 followers on Facebook. Most of my work is focused on Facebook, so the blocking deprives me of the opportunity to work normally. \nPlease unblock my facebook profile.\nSincerely, Anatolii Sharij."
