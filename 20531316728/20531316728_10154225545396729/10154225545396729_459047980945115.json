        "message": "I live in Lodi, CA., not as big as Seattle, but as I drive around town, I see homeless people everywhere! It breaks my heart! My husband, granddaughter & I give them food.....I just can't go out and eat, with a clear conscience, and not give them something to eat! If they need change, we give them what we have. But as they're are more & more homeless, I feel we need to do more! What you are doing is wonderful! Thank you for this generous idea! \"And the greatest of these are Charity, (Love).\" God Bless You All!  \ud83d\ude07"
