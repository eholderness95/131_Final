        "message": "i live in NJ right near NYC. My wife Renay Haflin Stafford and I started a charity, N.J. Food & Clothing Rescue. among the multitude of things we do is a weekly Saturday outreach in Newark, NJ. We have been doing this for awhile and have grown to know many of the people we help. Some are around for awhile...others just disappear. We have found that many are artists or have a talent of some kind and we are hoping to sponsor a homeless art expo/talent showcase in 2016. This can help them in a variety of ways, not only financially but with self esteem  and hope for the future as well. I think your innovative approach to helping them is exactly whats needed."
