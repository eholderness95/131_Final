REALLY?  REALLY?  Female friends of mine have been sexually harassed and physically threatened by people, usually strangers, they report it and You tell them \"this does not violate our community standards\". What are You possibly thinking?  You have Your priorities completely backwards Facebook.  And You seem to have the time and resources to respond to so many other people on these post.....   It would be nice if You would respond to me...  For once.  I send You direct messages....  You do not respond.  I go to Your \"Help Center\" and voice my concerns and explain my confusion...  You do not respond.   Pathetic"
