        "message": "Your awesome, these people all have a sad story! It could happen to any of us, so we need to have compassion and care about these people!!  I've had the opportunity to meet many homeless people, it is heart wrenching!!!  They are not meant to be looked down on, they need to be lifted up!!!!  It feels great to help them!! I challenge everyone to step up to the plate and help and not turn your back!!!!  This could be one of us or our children/family members!!  It's cold and raining today, just imagine the struggle!  They are so grateful for anything!!"
