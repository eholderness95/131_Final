        "message": "Hey there is a fellow on 35th and 80th NE outside the QFC. He and his partner and his German Shepard are living in there truck. They are cold and need help. Any help. Please if you can, stop by .. He is usually out around 3. I'm taking them hand and feet warmers, a warm shirt and blanket I always leave him with 20$ but anything you can give would help immensely. His partner recently had surgery and trying to heal in this cramped and cold truck. Dogs name is Buddy. They are just north of the Wedgewood Broiler on 35th. NE. Thank you if you can help in any way. Also they did have a trailer that the city towed away. Anyone have an extra trailer ???"
