            "message": "Facebook Good morning - I am contacting you about a problem that has occurred while using my Facebook the past few days, in hopes that someone can help me or show me a little bit of favor. I write personal devotions to encourage people. Recently, I have had problems sharing my devotionals...as Facebook blocks my ability to do so within a process of a few shares. Over the past three days, I was blocked after sharing it with many of the groups that I belonged to...I understood at the time, as I belong to many groups. However, this morning, I was blocked from the feature after only sharing three posts! I don't think that is right....as Facebook is the place for connecting and inviting. I would appreciate if you could consider this matter, and either help me or direct me to someone who can.; Thank you so much.."
