        "message": "Amazing!  There are so many good deeds out there that go unoticed.  For instance, in the Hispanic community we all know about \"machismo\" and no one really has targeted the hispanic women and tried to let them know its not ok to be mistreated by the machista man.  Ya Basta a nonprofit has created the first awareness through its programs and has gathered known hispanic celebs here is the usa to film 2 PSA all pro bono.How do I bring those to your attention or to the Hispanic facebook followers? Ya Basta (means enough) does not ask for money they just want to recondition the way latina women see themselves within their culture. Thank you for your time!"
