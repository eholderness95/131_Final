        "message": "What a great story about helping the homeless in Seattle.  Unlike our Mayor Mike Villalta in Los Banos  CA  that makes every effort to harass the homeless everyday hoping that they move away from our city.  The homeless have been targeted from one location to another constantly.  Recently the city had the opportunity to accept a grant to help the homeless, instead he received another grant to hire Enforcement Officers.  The homeless need help, not more harassment.  Hopefully in November 2016, this community will elect a new mayor, who cares about all residents, including the homeless."
