I remember being in down Dallas,tx where I grew up,at Christmas time ,I think I was 13 , there was a huge Christmas tree brought and placed in downtown, and my dad and i would take can food and put it under the tree for the homeless,my dad and me would leave the scene and we looked back and a man ran up and grabbed the food, I remember breaking down and crying....I was sad because I ran out of food to give them.."
