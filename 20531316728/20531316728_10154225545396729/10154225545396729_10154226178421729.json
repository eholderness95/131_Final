        "message": "The generosity and beauty of the human spirit is a precious thing to witness. Both of my precious brothers at different times in their life were  homeless. Now they have an eternal home with Jesus whenever I see a homeless person I think of them... the choices that they made or not work I would have wanted for them, and in the end they chose Jesus who never left them or forsook them. I'm so blessed by the story and thankful for a man who went outside the box to love and generously give of his time and spirit and meet the needs of those whom God loves so dearly."
