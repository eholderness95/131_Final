            "message": "Hi there, Alda. #GivingTuesday is a global day dedicated to giving back. People use Facebook to raise awareness and support for causes they care about \u2014 and they motivate others to do the same. People raise money for disaster relief, they search for missing children, and they bring attention to the issues that are near and dear to their hearts. For Giving Tuesday, we wanted to remind people about the power of giving back. -Kate"
