I like to scroll open links and then go back and read them when I'm done reading the other news feeds. Its really annoying when you are scrolling through and then the news feeds zip back to the top because fb is moving them around so most popular are at top. Then you have to rescroll through them all to get back to where you were. Would rather just have news feeds by time order rather then buy newest comment or like popularity"
