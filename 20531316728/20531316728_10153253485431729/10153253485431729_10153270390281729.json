I warned my friend and everyone to be careful because the message was a fraudulent action trying to get a personal information...Of course, I sent a message to that intruder and I warned her that her message was forwarded to the Attorney General. We must be careful and do not believe any stupid message.  The best thing is to report it to Facebook, and our Attorney General, because they can investigate and caught  the intruders."
