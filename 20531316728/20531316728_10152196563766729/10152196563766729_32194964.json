        "message": "I have a gripe...ya know if someone sends you a friend request and you report them because you \"dont know them\" a message to that person why they sent it to you might be nice first. something you said may have been inspiring or they may just want to be your friend because they to are in recovery...I am hurt that whoever reported me would do this and pray for you because a character defect lies there as probably does with myself for getting upset but I need positive ppl in my life as within my friends list and that's all im trying to do... I am sending this in all my recovery groups because that's the only ppl ive sent too...I am also sending this to facebook!! believe me I know facebook doesn't care bout our efforts!"
