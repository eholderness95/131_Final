        "message": "that is right. treat the person as a friend enjoy every minute of it.. dont forget that, that person is not perfect neither.. a friend is there on the good and bad times.. But a friend is not seem as one when that friend takes advantage on what the other person is there for; a friendship does not grow up one day it take time as any other relationships.. a friend is there on any situations is no to take revange when your friend tells you your wrong doing as well your attributes; a real friend does not cover your wrong doing. . A FRIEND WANTS A BEST ON YOUR LIFE. AMEN TO THAT"
