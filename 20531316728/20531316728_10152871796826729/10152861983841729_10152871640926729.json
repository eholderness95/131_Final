        "message": "Years ago I had a Harley motorcycle.  It didn't have a gauge to tell you how much gas you had left, but there was a switch that you could turn to allow you to use a little bit left in a separate reservoir (about a quart if I remember right).  Sometimes I'd ride, just \"taking any old road, going nowhere\", and ride until I switched tanks...and then I'd have to ride to try to find a station.  Quite a few times I didn't, but I could usually pull up to a farmhouse and the farmer would let me have a gallon or so of  \"farm gas\" - some of the most delightful trips I ever made were these \"trips to nowhere\"!  :)."
