        "message": "I have been to 38 states and three other countries. There are many beautiful places, but I will have to say, my favorite place is Cade's Cove in the smokies. It is so peaceful,and serene,depending on the traffic of course. My imagination can run wild as I think of the settlers who first came there, and what life must have been like for them, knowing that it must have been hard. I love to sing in those old Churches and imagine the settlers worshipping there. And the children running and playing in that beautiful place. Oh I'm making myself homesick for the mountains. Have a blessed day in GODs creation wherever it may be."
