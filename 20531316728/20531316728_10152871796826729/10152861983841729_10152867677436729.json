I had been to church for years, but until I was truly born again, saved simply by believing God loves me and gave His Son for my salvation, it was not my favorite place.  Moral of the story, at least mine, is that a place changes depending upon with whom you share it."

Chances are no one will renounce their faith because of what someone said online, no matter how much evidence you lay in from of them. Even if you use bible verses to question the religion, some will just tell you they believe in the teachings of Jesus. Beliefs can and will be altered to fit present-day cultural norms, even if that means some passages are ignored by theists."
