For example, women love to share recipes, but i can't always retrieve when I need a particular one. Nor do I always want to share with all my friends since some don't care to receive so many recipe posts. I feel badly inundating all my friends with lots of posts. Could FB perhaps create a recipe file to create a cookbook, if you will? ALSO, it would be great to be able to keep group posts within the group and not have all friends privy to these posts. Thank you!"

You can also set a group to secret so no one can see what is posted in there. A recipe file specifically for people like you probably won't happen, but create a group, invite all of your single mom friends, and share your recipes in there."
