        "message": "Kudos to Facebook and Mark for the recent improvements to Facebook! I had provided my feedback for Facebook to become more user-friendly and you not only made the necessary prompt adjustments, but even went beyond my initial suggestion. I'm not sure. Probably, my opinion is just one of many of a similar nature. But still, I have to credit the Facebook team for its customer service standards. Keep going and keep up the good work! Cheers! :D"
