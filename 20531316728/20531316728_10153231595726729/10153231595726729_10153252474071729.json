If you can unblock them anytime you please and still be friends you can view their details while they are AFK and then block them again before they get back to a computer. There has to be a disconnect first before the restraining order. You don't hug people you have a restraining order against so don't block someone you want to stay friends with. Use the stop notifications and acquaintance status options on them next time.\n\nAnd maybe someday @Facebook will employ some form of \"game theory\" like Cityville so people can see visually who can accessthe posts at each privacy setting and then rearrange their friends' avatars accordingly, visually, more lifelike-ably."
