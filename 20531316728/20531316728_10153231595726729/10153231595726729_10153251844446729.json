For example, you can choose how much strangers can see on your facebook page, and once they are friends, they can see everything that has been set visible to friends. A blocked person is even below a stranger, where they aren't even able to get to your profile by searching for it, although if they saved the url they can get to it, but they would see the same as a stranger would, with the addition of being unable to contact them."
