There is a button under the video but I can only select pics for the center pic at the end. If I press on a Pic for the video it just gives me a short section of comments I wrote and 2-3 pics that were part of the comment for example a magazine cover. What am I doing wrong? Help please & thank you!"

The only thing I can edit is the picture in the middle at the end. I cannot edit any pictures for the entire video because when I click on to edit a picture for the video not the center picture it shows me a lineup of post I recently posted which just shows comments. This does not give me pics to choose from like the one for the center photo at the end or let me go to my own photos from 2016. Again you did not answer my question on what I am doing wrong you did not help me & I'm incredibly frustrated. I give up on your 2016 year in review because it sucks. Hope next year you find a way to make it much easier for Facebook users currently I give it a one star rating. Thanks for not helping~sarcasm! Next time have a human answer instead of a machine."
