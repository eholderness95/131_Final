I live in Australia she on the other side of the world. She loved to see my pictures and everything until she were blocked by Facebook for no reason. Facebook is trying to get government IDs from everyone. This is ridiculous. So my Mother who do not want to send sensitivr data to a none government authority like Facebook to get verified. And you have no option like getting certified by a phone number. What's better a verification by a real phone number or a picture which you can easily fake."
