That's what slideshows are, you take a bunch of photos and Facebook compiles a \"slide show that only you can see\" unless you allow it to post. However, it should be noted that someone sees it because any nudity (or just unpleasant buttocks photos that I took myself) means no slideshow is \"generated\". Someone has access to your photos on your phone at all times lol"
