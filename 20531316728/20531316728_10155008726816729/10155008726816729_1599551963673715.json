Once you cut me off I get a pop-up telling me to advertise - to my own fans? If you want to really help me contact me - no trite marketing paste & copy relies -"

This is described in more detail here: http://bit.ly/2e8PFmB. There are several other ways to let people know about upcoming events, which you can learn about here: http://bit.ly/2elrQ6a. Hope this helps! -Nick"
