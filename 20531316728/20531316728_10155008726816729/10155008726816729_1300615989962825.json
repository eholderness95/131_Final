        "message": "when one reports a fake facebook site or facebook post you should give us the option to report them for committing fraud or deceiving the public (that should be a reason alone). NO be blocking them will not solve the situation. A lot of older people (grandparents) fall for these scams. Give us the option to click \"this person is trying to commit a fraudulent act\" or something like that please... Fake disney sites, fake \"free vacation\" sites, fake student loan relief sites. It gets tiring to see people falling for this."

The scammers should not just be \"blocked\" but should be called out for what they are and deleted.  There are rings of scammers in various places who set up FB pages with stolen pictures.  Look at VanRobert Hawkins, which I reported.  That page has stolen pictures of an army chaplain.  Then, Jeffrey Hawkins (which is actually the name of the Army Chaplain).  But, I can guarantee you that the real Army Chaplain Col. Jeffrey Hawkins DID NOT set up that FB page.   The person who stole Col. Hawkins pictures set it up and brazenly used the Col's real name.   This stuff needs to be stopped by Facebook."
