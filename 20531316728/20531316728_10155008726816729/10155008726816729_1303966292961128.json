        "message": "Do you think FB users would like to have an option to send a private message or post to a page at a different time of Day, Week or Month. Here are some reasons this would be useful; 1. To not cause a message alarm on a cell phone at an unwelcome time. 2. To make it appear one is posting at home while they are away. 3. To send a congratulation on or at a specific time and not forget. 4. To hide (or disguise) ones activity at a certain time. The latter may not be reasonable or ethical (especially if hiding cheating on a partner) but the first two are very valid reasons for this request. What can you do?"
