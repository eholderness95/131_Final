Doesn't seem that anyone in the FB system is able (or willing) to help since she didn't use any of the security options that were available (trusted friends, secret passwords etc), and none of us knew (or remembered) the password she might have used. I don't particularly fancy the idea that her account lives on without we having control of it..."

My mother first used my dad's old email account (which no-one can access ATM, as it has been discontinued), then, a couple of years before her death, she changed the password for the old account, and created a new FB account using my dad's *current* email address. This account we DO have the password for, but not the old one - and that's the account dad would like to gain access to - and continue using (and maybe even change to his own email address). Hope this post wasn't confusing, and made some sense..?"
