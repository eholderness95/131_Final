We currently got a grey badge for our page on Facebook but we would like to upgrade it to be a blue badge.\n\nCould please let us know how to upgrade it? Right now, the blue badge request is not available in our country (but some businesses pages and artists has been verified, ex: fb.com/brodoindonesia).\n\nAs one of radio station in Makassar, Indonesia. We really hope that our Facebook businesses page could be verified too and our Instagram account as well.\n\nWe are looking forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you.\nRegards,\nAchlan Fahlevi"
