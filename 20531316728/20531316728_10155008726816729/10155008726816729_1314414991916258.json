I applied for a job once, because your company seems to really care about its employees. Facebook has allowed me to reconnect with so many people, make new friends and make a difference in my community.  I don't know what I would do without it...it's been my lifeline. \n\nI am not saying that I am on it 24-7 and that it takes over my whole life.  But it has changed me and made my life so much better!!! I just wanted to say thank you!!!!"
