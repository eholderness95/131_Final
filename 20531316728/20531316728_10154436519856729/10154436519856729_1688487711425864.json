There are enough ridiculous conflicts on Facebook over written reaction as it is, NO NEED for a \"dislike button.\" These reaction options give you more ways to show you saw the post, & can give a more appropriate response with a touch of a button.

Everyone has done as they have been asked and got NO help! I for one can log into another account on any of my devices and be able to use the reactions where as if i'm logged into mine the reactions disappear. Please help!"
