        "message": "Facebook - on the Market Search, it would be helpful if when someone clicks interested, Facebook would ask you to verify your interest.  I sometimes click interested by accident and next thing I know I\u2019m getting a messenger message from the seller.  All this time they are thinking they have a sale and I have to explain I clicked interested by mistake.  Thank you for your help with this."
