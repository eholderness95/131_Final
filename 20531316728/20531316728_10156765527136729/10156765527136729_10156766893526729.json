        "message": "Dear Facebook,\nI know I'm using an outdated Google Chrome browser on an outdated Windows XP SP3 platform, but I can't afford a new computer at the time. My question is: Why can't I drag&drop an item (photo, video) in a Edit status box? It's working perfectly fine on twitter, but not on Facebook. I have to search every image by hand and it's frustrating because I have no time to rename every item I save on my computer. Please help, sort this out."
