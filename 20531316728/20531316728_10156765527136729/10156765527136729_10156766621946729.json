Where there is a police officer who is the administrator to the site who is blocking citizens from making comments. This officer is stealing our constitutional rights of freedom of speech. I please ask everybody to go to the Suffolk police Facebook site and ask who the administrator is and why they have the audacity to block people illegally while they stand there in uniform under oath to protect everybody's rights."
