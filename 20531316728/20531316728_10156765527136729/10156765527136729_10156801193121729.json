        "message": "Facebook I have no idea what I have done to be temporarily blocked from posting in groups, or even joining new groups but it happened to me this morning. I live in VA and no one has been able to help me. I put up a post with 10 pics of baby items that my kids no longer use, and I wanted to sell them to be able to get money for them to have at least a halfway decent Christmas this year and I was sent in my notifications that stated I am temporarily blocked from posting in any groups or joining any new groups until December 5th at 6:22 am. I highly doubt that I will be able to sell the stuff that I had on there in time to get the money to get my kids their Christmas this year. Please reply back as soon as u r able to."
