I want them found and posted onto his page, and I want you to come back here and tell me it has been done.  This is my second request.  I can catch Zuckerburg on one of his interviewsm and he wouldn't want that......so  someone get it done, or explain to my why it cant be done..  Needless to say, I am extremely ticked off."
