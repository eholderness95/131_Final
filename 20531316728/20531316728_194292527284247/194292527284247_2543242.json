        "message": "I wanna know when Facebook are going to clamp down on Game providers that are ripping people off.  I point to Playfish that blame Facebook to get out of any issues and repay people.  Seriously how can you let them rip people off.  Its your Database and its only a matter of time before your on the wrong end of a court case, specailly as Facebook credits are going to be used in all games.  No way of stopping apps ripping people and blaming Facebook.  Get a grip of this, because this is going to bring Facebook to a big end if you don't.  Im predicting this."
