I heard you and Whatsapp are now a team and i can't use it anymore.. and i heard that we have to pay for it well sorry but why should we buy it like many people need whatsapp to chat with their friends and now suddenly everything is ruined. I know there's viber but almost no one uses it and whatsapp so much fun and now soon when it returns we have to pay so that we can chat with our friends...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
