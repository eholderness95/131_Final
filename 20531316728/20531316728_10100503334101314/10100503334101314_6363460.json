HOWEVER...and this is a big however, what have you folks done to my wall???  there have always been those annoying ads along the sides of my fb stuff, but today you have elected to put singles ads and assorted crap ads RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY WALL????  you can not be serious!  while i'm posting a comment, i am forced to look at some half naked chick asking if i want to date her???  i am a 51 yr. old woman that finds that more than offensive!  i am furious dudes...seriously.  i have spent the past few years waking up everyday to my fb friends and family and loving all the connections.  now you slap 1/2 naked chicks on my wall and on my newsfeed???  today will be my last day on fb unless you get rid of such offensive crap!  if you think i'm angry guys...just wait until more women see it and respond...\nthanks for screwing up a good thing!\ndana j. hidalgo\nwindsor, ca"
