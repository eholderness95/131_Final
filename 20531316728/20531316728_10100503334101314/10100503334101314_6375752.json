        "message": "The ability to \"View Comments\" in one place from all albums is an integral part of having a business page on FB. This is where the majority of business is generated. If we no longer have this option, then we will generate less business, which means having a FB business page is no longer necessary or worth the effort we all put into it. Please either return this feature or create a better option. It hurts you as much as it hurts the businesses."
