I was wondering if someone could please help me be able to login on this facebook account? The person who was managing this facebook page for our company no longer is employed with us. No one knows what the login and password information is. We either want to delete this page so that we can create a new one or be able to have access to new login information. Thank you so much for your assistance."

From there, you can remove their administrator access and continue to maintain or delete the Page. Learn more here: http://bit.ly/2dMAqj9. -Joe"
