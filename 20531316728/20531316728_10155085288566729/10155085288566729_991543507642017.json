The violation of privacy can be punished by law (UCC 1-308- 1 1 308-103 and the Rome Statute). NOTE: Facebook is now a public entity. All members must post a note like this. If you do not publish a statement at least once, it will be tacitly understood that you are allowing the use of your photos, as well as the information contained in your profile status updates.

When you sign up for an account in Facebook, you are agreeing to their contract regarding privacy and lack thereof.  That agreement even states clearly that you are giving them permission to use photos.  You should read agreements online the same as you would read a contract you put your signature on anywhere else in life.  If you post something here (or anywhere on the internet in reality), it is NOT private.  Don't post something that you don't want revealed somewhere.  It's a simple rule."
