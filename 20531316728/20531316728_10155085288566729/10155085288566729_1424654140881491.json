            "message": "Hi, Paul. We require everyone using Facebook to use their real name and birthday. This way, you always know who you're connecting with. When we discover accounts that look fake or like they\u2019re using fake information, we ask the owner to confirm that they are who they say they are. In most cases, the easiest way to confirm your identity is to follow the on-screen steps to enter your mobile phone number and request a code.\n\nIf can't verify your account using your mobile number, you'll need to provide a copy of your photo ID. This could be a scanned copy or a close-up photo you've taken. We'll permanently delete this document after we resolve your issue. Review what types of IDs we accept: http://bit.ly/2ejqbmL.\n\nTo learn about our policies, please visit the Facebook Community Standards :https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards. -Rhea"
