I want my last account back. I have too much there to lose it. I am an American man living in the Philippines. I can scan and send a copy of my US Passport and my Philippine drivers' license. Can you please help me to recover my account because who ever did this to me has set my account for deletion so this matter is time sensitive. I'd appreciate a prompt response. Thank you very much!"
