I have been struggling with life I manage to get a job with amazon as a picker but its not my passion, my passion is computers and technology cause its my stronger skill set. I am trying to get back on my feet and pay all this debt that I have that destroyed me. I am living in a veterans transition home cause I could not afford housing. I lost my previous job due to cut hours or funding issue which was an IT job."
