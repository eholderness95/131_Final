We thought it would save on facebook as all the other live videos of the day did except for the wedding. People were able to watch the live feed but now the video is gone. Is there anyway to get the video back? It seems odd that the video just disappeared yet every other video we broadcasted of the day stayed on my timeline except the wedding video. Please help. thanks"
