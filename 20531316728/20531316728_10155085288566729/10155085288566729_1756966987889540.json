So, may i ask when will FB team check and fix the issue for me after my report again there? Actually, the problem was solved suddenly 3 months ago after i repeatedly sent msg thru messenger and fb page, though no one replied me, my \u201con that day\u201d appeared suddenly by lasting just 2 days. It disappeared again after till now.....Anyway, is that i should post the feature issue i encountered in \u201cWhat happens when I report that something isn't working on Facebook\u201d? Thanks so much."
