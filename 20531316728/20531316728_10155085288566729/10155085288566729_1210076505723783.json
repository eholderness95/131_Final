Already turned to that person with a few choice words of my own so they'd see how \"nice\" it feels and to leave my friend alone. At what point can we report someone for bullying?"

Any sane person would want bullying to have consequences, especially if the bully is a snotty obnoxious high schooler who has no clue about life, insulting someone who is already struggling in life. So yeah, your input isn't needed, to be honest."
