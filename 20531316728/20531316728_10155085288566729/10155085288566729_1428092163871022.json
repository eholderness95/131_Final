Unfortunately, there have been  times when I received message requests from people who I have no mutual requests with and they ended up being important but I wasn't able to see them because of the previous settings I set regarding messages. Is there a way for me to receive notifications when I do receive those message requests? Or do I have to make it so that everyone can directly send me messages?"
