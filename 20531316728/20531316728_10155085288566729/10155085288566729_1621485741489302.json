I use my nickname for everything and everybody. I haven't a scanner (broke down) but  how I can give you my 'legal' name for legal 'stuff.'  Actually my nickname was shortened for this and other groups I belong to because some people us it and some use the rrie behind it. Now I've confused the hell out of myself!"
