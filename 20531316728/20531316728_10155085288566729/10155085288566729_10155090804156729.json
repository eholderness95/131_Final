To keep ads as high quality and engaging as possible, our Advertising Policies state that ads may not include more than 20% text in the image: http://bit.ly/2e4K7oj. Before creating an ad, we recommend that you use our grid tool to see if your ad image meets the 20% text limit: http://bit.ly/2dPV2XC. You can also learn more about using text within ad images here: http://bit.ly/2dPXsFK.\nIf you have an ad that you think follows our policies and shouldn't have been disapproved, please let us know: http://bit.ly/2e4JNpq. -Joe"
