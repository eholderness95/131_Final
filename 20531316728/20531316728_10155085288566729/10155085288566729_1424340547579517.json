I keep getting post telling me to cut and paste something on my page so that Facebook doesn't Share it randomly. I know that anything on social media is able to be seen by police and things like that but surely Facebook isn't going to post my private message on messager just because that can. Please respond I have tried to tell people but since I am so new to the Facebook world nobody believes me."
