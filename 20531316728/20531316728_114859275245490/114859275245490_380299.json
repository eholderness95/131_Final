I got spam today from  Obama and others seeking  to know my voting locations, etc. As a goverment worker we were  not allowed to use Facebook due to it's \"compromises\".  How dare you give or sell my personal email and allow us all to be personally invaded and angered.  I hate that sob. You are not monitoring spam and security! I had to block each game I play as spam today!"
