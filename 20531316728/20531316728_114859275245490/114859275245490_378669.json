        "message": "Dear facebook, I love facebook but, I am having trouble being able to get my gift requests! I will accept them then I will go back and they are still there. I will then ignore them and I go back and they are still there. What is the problem with this? I would just for once like to accept my gifts and be done with it. I know I can not have More than one hundred gifts everyday! There is something wrong, so can you please fix this PLEASE? I also send gift requests to my friends and half of them are not receiving them. So what is going on with this? Is it a problem you all are going to fix?"
