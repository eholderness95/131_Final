        "message": "Safety my you know what . You try to report a page like free items in Klamath falls . And Facebook only looks at original post and not the harassing and bullying comments on it . Then tell u they see nothing wrong and you can't write and tell Facebook on why you are reporting them ? And the administrator is one of the bullies . There page said no drama and treat others kind lol that's joke I was attacked for my opinion and made fun of because I'm disabled then after I left group 2 different guys pm me and called me names and said I couldn't hide . Well done Facebook way to protect people on your website !"
