I'd share a pic to a group page that was on my timeline, and the people in the group couldn't see it.  It turns out it's a permissions thing. T he best thing to do is re-upload onto the group page, not share to the group page.  This happens if you have friends in the group that are not your friends on FB (other than through that group)."
