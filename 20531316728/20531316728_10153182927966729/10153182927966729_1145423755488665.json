I'm delighted to hear that you ignored the rediculous plea from Kanye West for $1 billion \"in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world\". First of all, ideas are Free. Some are brilliant, others are ludicrious. As all creative people know, ideas come from using the grey matter between your ears. Apparently Kanye does not have the ability to access this area."
