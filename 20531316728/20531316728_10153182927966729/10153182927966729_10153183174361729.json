I am tired of constantly changing my News Feed to Most Recent and when I do, the \"most recent\" stories are from 5 hours ago... the only way I can see what my friends are really up to is to check their pages... and I doubt many of you will see this because they are censoring what we actually see. \nWe need alternatives, something like what we used to have when FB started, something we can use to catch up with friends and family and NOT have someone censuring what we wanted to see and replacing it with what they want us to buy!!!!"
