Then listen to the questions being asked because the questions I originally asked was NOT answered and that is very frustrating.  So let me try this one more time and see if anyone from FB is listening.  I had a last name change to McMurray (got married) when I went in to change the name I MISSPELLED IT!!!!  So I went in to correct my error and there is a AUTHENTICITY RULE or whatever you want to call it that states I have to wait 60 days after a change has been made.  WHHHHATTTTT????  your kidding me right.  I MADE A MISTAKE and I need TO CORRECT it and there is no other way than to wait 60 days!!!!!!!!REALLY!!!!  Give me a break we can put men on the moon....there has got to be a way to correct a mistake of a name change!!!!!  Are you LISTENING!!!!!"
