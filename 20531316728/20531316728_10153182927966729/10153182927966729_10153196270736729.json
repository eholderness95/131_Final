        "message": "There is a page, Dog Fighting, just for fun. I understand that it is a page originated in another country and it is legal in that country. I know people have reported the content and your response is that it isn't illegal in the originating country. While I understand freedom of speech (even though it's not an American page) I cannot understand why Facebook  thinks the content is acceptable.  There is a big difference between illegal activity and appropriate content  that is accessed by audiences of all ages. Consider the minimum age of Facebook users, this page should be filtered from American streams.   Please rethink your policy."
