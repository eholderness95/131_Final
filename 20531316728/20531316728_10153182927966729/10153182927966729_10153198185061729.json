        "message": "I reported this page, and facebook reviewed it and said it didnt jave anything wrong ?! Are you kidding me? This page shows naked photos of my friend who is 16 and another girl that is 14. This is child pornagraphy !!! Or am i wrong ? Is that a good thing ? Does facebook like that? Becoouse they seem to not care enough to delete the page !! I hate the fact that facebook never really does anything about it ! Thanks Facebook now my friends (who is a minor ) nude photos will always be on facebook for milliones of pervets can get on the page and steal them ! This unacceptable ! I hope that she doesnt get depreesed becouse this will end up being your foult too ! Becouse you though the page had nothing wrong !"
