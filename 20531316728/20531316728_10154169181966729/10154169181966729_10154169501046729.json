It doesn't matter who you are or what you believe, karma, yin yang, reap what you sow, do unto others....it seems to just work that way to me my friend. I liked seeing those who are blind in this video smile, if Facebook is bringing joy to people's lives, I hope they continue to be blessed. And Al I hope you are blessed too man. :)"
