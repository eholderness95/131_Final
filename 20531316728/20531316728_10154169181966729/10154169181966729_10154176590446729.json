I have several blind and low vision patients and I frequently describe photos and read the timelines / stories on thier family members and friends facebook pages so they too can experience what we take for granted.  Your technology is life changing and I just wanted to say thank you.  I always carry my phone with me to their homes as they look forward to me being able to pull up their loved ones facebook so I can read thier time lines and describe photos for them.  Amazing job facebook team.."
