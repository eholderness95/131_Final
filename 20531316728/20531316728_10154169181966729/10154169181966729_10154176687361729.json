        "message": "I thought Facebook was already the most amazing thing ever by letting me reconnect with friends from long ago who are far away and stay in touch and see on a daily basis family members who live all over the country and their kids growing up!! And now this...this technology almost made me cry for the joy it will give people who cannot see.  Thank you for continuing to advance your research and technology!! And I still don't know how I'm allowed this gift without paying for it...lol...but thank you!!"
