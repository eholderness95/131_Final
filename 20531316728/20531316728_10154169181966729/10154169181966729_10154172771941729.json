        "message": "Hey Facebook team. I have a quick question, my friend Genelle Egidio Herbst sent me a friend, but instead accepting her request I pressed ignore by mistake. Now we are block  for sending friend requests each other, I didn't know that nowadays friend request are so sensitivity in that way. I remember that if you delete a friend request, you will be able to resend it again since I did it before. \n\nMy question is: there is any possibility that we can be friend again and don't being block in that way. And I don't have her name in my block list \n\nThanks you for helping me with this"
