If I'm not using the facebook app and I'm in google chrome on the internet and I click to share something on facebook, it showed up on Facebook that someone else logged into my account from Chicago Illinois. But it was ME!!! It also tells me to click if it was me and then to remember the browser. I click it every time but it never remembers. I hope this is what's happening to you, instead of someone actually hacking in!"
