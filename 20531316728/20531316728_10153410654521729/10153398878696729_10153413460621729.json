        "message": "Hello facebook team, I've just received notification that a report I had filed against an abusive post has been denied. I congratulate you on having a feedback option on the review AFTER the fact. My problem is that the post was not removed under the reasoning \"does not violate community standards\". The report I filed was against a woman who has posted a photograph, name, and address for my mother on her public page and has threatened harm to her, and has requested her fb friends to do the same. If this is not considered an abusive post then I don't know what is. Posting personal information of people you don't know and threatening them harm seems pretty worthy of removal to me. I hope in the future you will take a closer look at some legitimate claims made in your reporting process."
