Top Stories is the result of our findings, which is why it is the default. We know that some people prefer the Most Recent view, so we've kept this option available. If you have specific thoughts you want to share, please let us know here: http://on.fb.me/1rmVirO -Hailey"

I guess my employer likes the top stories because I am usually off FACEBOOK in less than a minute, but when I had most recent i would be engaged in FACEBOOK much much longer."
