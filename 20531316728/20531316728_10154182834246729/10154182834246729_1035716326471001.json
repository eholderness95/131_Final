There are so many that think they could do better, well we will see after the elections.  It's Hilley or Donald I'm not loosing sleep over either one of them. We have to trust God will inspire the voters to sent the best in to take your place.  Go out of office with a smile and your hear up high.  Enjoy the future with a beautiful wife and the girls. All and all your a lucky man. I will never get to meet you but your in my prayers my Blessing. Fr. Gill"
