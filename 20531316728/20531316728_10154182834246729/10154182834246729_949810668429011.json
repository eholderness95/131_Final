        "message": "Mr president I have an idea on saving social security.  Take 100 dollars for every man woman in the family per month  and the nation would be in the green not just social security because Congress  keep taking from it and that will hurt all the people that have worked all our life for. The census should prove this point. The government will give out picture id's to present to hospital's etc. I constantly  remind people that the 3 houses make the laws not the president. No one will change my  mind  that you have done a great job especially bringing the insurance company to the hill to explain why we have paid premiums and then deny because you should have known somewhere in your family it is there. Thank you for you and Michelle the most wonderful people president  in history"
