        "message": "President Obama Please leave our 2nd Amendment Rights alone!! These rights were given to us by our forefathers to help law abiding Americans protect themselves and their families. To hunt and feed our families and to use in case of an invasion on our soil. So please stop blaming violence on guns. People kill people, not guns. They as anything else just become a weapon of choice."
