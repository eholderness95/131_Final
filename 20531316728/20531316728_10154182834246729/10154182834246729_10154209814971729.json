        "message": "Climate change should be one of the last things on your agenda at this time. I'm having a hard time figuring out why there is not funds for social security,etc. and money to house, feed, and provide medical care to all these refugees you want to invite in. I believe in helping people but charity begins at home. As far as your health care plan, those who were free loading are still doing the same thing, while most of those who always had insurance are paying more. Bottom line--I will be glad when your term ends. I support Dr Carson 100%."
