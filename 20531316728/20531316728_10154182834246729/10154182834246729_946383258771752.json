        "message": "Thank you Mr. President for struggling through your years as President of our country to try and make this world a better place.  I personally appreciate all that you have done and all that you have tried to do.  You must be tired of all the haggling by now, but I want to encourage you not to give up or give in in your last year as President.  Continue to fight the good fight and continue to be the conscientious and compassionate human being that you are.  Thank you!  Jan Schulman"
