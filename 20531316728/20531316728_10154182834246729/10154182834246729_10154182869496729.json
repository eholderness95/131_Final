I'm not a Democrat, but I can be respectful towards the commander and chief, and to the office. Though I don't agree with certain policies and ideologies, that doesn't mean I am excused to be inconsiderate and rude.\n\nShame on you guys. And don't you realize that comments like that can get you flagged by the FBI? Come on, grow up.\n\nJesus bless."
