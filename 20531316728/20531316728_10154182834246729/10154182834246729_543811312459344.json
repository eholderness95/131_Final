He walks in the yard going to dinner enjoying Gods nature, trees animals,birds, and our peaceful sky's. This is not true for most countries. So the calendar is getting closer to moving day I do hope the his First Lady is looking to copy the house yard and his peaceful time of Martha Vineyards.  Please don't worry the public has the same calendar but Not counting your days left but counting down the time you start your knew chapter of where and what is next on your agenda and the wonderful home you chose.  Good luck in your next chapter."
