        "message": "I just turned 70 years old worked all my life I have four grandsons who I'm really worried about that they won't be able to go to college or enjoy the things that we enjoyed growing up not only just the pollution butt the way people address each other my 13 year old grandson was held up at gunpoint by two other teenagers and then 2 weeks later my niece who's grown was also held up and carjacked comma, the violence has really gotten out of hand we live in a decent areayou cant go to the store you can't walk home without the fear of somebody coming up behind you why can't we afford to hire more qualified police officers increase the volume of the police officers services to stop. The jeanyou cant go to the store you can't walk home without the fear of somebody coming up behind you why can't we afford to hire more qualified police officers increase the volume of the police officers services to stop. The teen's have better weapons than police officerss, faster cars etc., anyway I joined on this page rather late because I normally don't go on Facebook. I love you to death as a human being and I think you had a big battle on your hands that you couldn't resolve due to the Republicans. I wish you nothing but the best once you retire from the White House enjoy your girls and your wife. thank you for listening"
