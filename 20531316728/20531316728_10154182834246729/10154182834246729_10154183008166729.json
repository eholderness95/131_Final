So people don't vote more than once, so  illegals can't vote, and the big favorite here in Louisiana.......so dead people can't vote! Oh yes, it's true. The dead get out to vote. It's a proven fact. It's how Senator  Mary Landrieu got elected in the first place. The names of the dead were printed in a newspaper!  Politics as usual in Louisiana. This is why Democrats won't pass voter ID laws. Sad. If Hillary wins, you can be sure it won't be honestly."
