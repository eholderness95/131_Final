        "message": "Always a blessing to have one knowledgeable and willing to use it for the good of all.  Personally, you are highly endowed and a blessing to mankind, you are a rare gem and we are very lucky to witness you in our life time.  Hold your head high and be proud.  So many may not approve of you but know that many look and will continue to look on to you as an exemplary role model for generations to come.  No one is liked by all and any leader expecting to be liked by everyone he/she leads would be highly disappointed because to accomplish some goals one may sometimes step on some toes.  It is very human.  Once again thank you Mr President for all the things you have done and still doing, you are appreciated!"
