I can guarantee you he will NEVER know what it is like to have to pay his own electric bills, or chop wood to stay warm. Nor will he have to decide to go without food and medicine in order to stay warm. When is the government going to end the ridiculous regulations that are financially strangling us? I might as well live in a third world country, compared to what Obama thinks the average American deals with. Get your head out of the sand and wake up! Americans are STARVING because of your policies. And your \"healthcare\" is useless, since even the doctors are quitting and getting jobs in the private sector. Even if I could find a doctor willing to accept your \"insurance\", it pays for NOTHING!!!!! And that is what I have for you, OBAMA. NOTHING!"
