        "message": "Thank you in advance for listening I am extremely concerned about the global warming issue but my concerns are not about the possibility that we are contributing to global warming but that even if we are (even though most scientists claim we are not the cause ) what possible good could spending billions of the worlds money possibly do? Are we egotistical enough to believe that we are the cause ?or can fix the problem .we have much more controllable issues that we can most definitely fix with all that money that would do more good for mankind . This global warming issue I believe is just an issue designed to distract the masses from the real issues that could be handled like the economy or the healthcare issue .thanks again and like you I would like to find real solutions to real problems"
