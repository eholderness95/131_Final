        "message": "Mr. president, by what moral law, do you destroy the coal industry of this country, shut down it's power plants, and all but put a stop to its oil industry,all in the name of Global Warming?.You live in a world of fear,Global warming, is at best, a theory.How can you morally make laws based on a theory? I have over 3,400 scientists,many with P.H.D.s, who have signed a petition saying that there is no such thing as man made global warming! Global Warming is a manipulation, to tax the people of the earth and to take away vital precious freedoms!You and those who believe like you are either naive, or against America! Where does your loyalty lie?  I encourage everyone to Google the {Global Warming Petition Project}."
