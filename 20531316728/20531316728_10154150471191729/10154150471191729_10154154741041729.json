The least important question is why don't have I have the option to share memories? They aren't on my page anywhere... I'd really like to have them.\nMy most important question: Is is possible to make sure that a family member's Facebook page who has passed away, unable to be accessed by other people? We want to keep the account open, but we want to make sure that it can't be tampered with. I'd appreciate any information that you can give"
