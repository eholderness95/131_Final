All she had to do was pay a certain amount for shipping fees. At first I thought it was legitimate, because it was a dear friend. Upon clolser research I realized it was not her at all.  I have the name, account number to the bank and a Facebook page he has. I have been ask to re-friend another friend by the same guy. Can you help stop this?"
