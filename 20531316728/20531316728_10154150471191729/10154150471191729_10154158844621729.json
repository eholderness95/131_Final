        "message": "My oversharing friends are Facebook ads. Can I unfollow them as a category? I am not anti-advertising. I know ads keep FB free, however, they belong in the right hand column as sponsored content. There's lots of room. I look there and click on those of interest.  But I will never ever click on an ad in the newsfeed.  They could advertise free money and I wouldn't click on it.  And please stop asking why I hide every ad in my newsfeed.  Duh--it's an ad."
