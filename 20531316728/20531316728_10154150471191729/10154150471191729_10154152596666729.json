        "message": "I need help logging into my fb account on my regular computer.  I locked myself out after having changed my pw and it keeps telling me it's not valid but it's what I have written down.  It says it is sending security codes to my email but it's not.  I've tried over and over.  Won't send to my phone either, says someone else on fb is using that cell number, which they aren't.  I even tried the get three friends to help option and only one received a security code.  I am still logged in on an old device.  That is how I'm messageing now.  Can someone help?"
