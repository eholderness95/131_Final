He is looking to communicate with someone from Facebook to discuss unique Facebook profile considerations that apply to these individuals.  These considerations include protecting these individuals from certain risks associated with navigating the internet as well as being taken advantage of.  Can you tell me how I can help my friend start a conversation with Facebook on this topic?  Thanks!"
