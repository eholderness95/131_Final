I  care about privacy and i should have the right to use a different last name for privacy issues. With that being said, I will put my real last name on if they let me into my account. But, since it isn't my real last name, I can't find anyone to talk to about the issue. How can i fix this ??? i think it's really crappy of someone to report me for no reason. I have a right to my privacy."
