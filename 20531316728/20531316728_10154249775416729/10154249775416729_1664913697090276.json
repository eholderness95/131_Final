            "message": "Hi Howard, well facebook says report these things but I tried to report something once and it first said I had to prove who \"I\" am! this was awful for me because I had created my facebook page back in 2004 or 2005 before it was a big deal if you used a nickname or your real name so I was unable to prove that I was Loca Lynn. I had never seen where it said I must use my real name so I then lost every friend that I had gotten from groups that I couldn't remember their last names (I have multiple sclerosis so I have bad memory problems) and I lost all the pictures that friends had sent to me. it was terrible! oh and I even lost videos of my friends childbirth and my dogs last few days of her life I had recorded too and put them in my video album thinking since everything is off my computer it was sorta like a back up in case my computer ever crashed, which it did just days before this happenbed so I lost them first on my computer and then on facebook. I wrote to facebook explaining that I had used a nickname a very long time ago and that I was trying to provide ID of who I really am but since it didn't match the name on my facebook it wouldn't let me back in and I begged and pleaded to at least let me get my video of my dog that died and of a childbirth of my best friend but they wouldn't even respond!!! I was left with the option of BE THE EXACT NAME OR BE IGNORED FOREVER. I think years of use and even a new facebook should show loyalty at the very least and get me SOMETHING, at least my photos and videos back to use on my page that now has my real name. Facebook could OBVIOUSLY tell it was a nickname, I mean who names their child LOCA which means crazy in Spanish? but anyway, before you REPORT anything make sure you have ID and SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER and be willing to wait days maybe months before they unfreeze your facebook page!!! Gee thanks facebook for keeping my most precious of precious items from me for no good reason!!"
