That happened on the morning of January 1, 2013\n\nThese four Facebook pages were totally peaceful and free of any hate speech, but you removed it ignoring the feelings of more than 9 Million Facebook Muslims and disrespecting over 1.5 Billion Muslims worldwide.\n\nAnd now since that is what it had come down to you, with your irresponsibility and fake preach of freedom of speech, have left us no other choice other than permanently boycotting Facebook. And now we are giving you a 2 weeks notice - ending at midnight of Thursday, February 21, 2013. - to fulfill our demands or else we will leave Facebook for http://madina.com/.\n\nOur demands are:\n\n1- Reactivating the four pages that have been disabled\n2- Adding a Facebook Term that illegalizes disrespecting Islamic religious symbols\n3- Disabling any Facebook Page, Group, or Event that shows direct or indirect disrespect towards Islamic religious symbols\n\nThe pages that were unfairly removed are:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Ashraf.Elkhalq.Mohammad - About 1,500,000 Likes"

Now.. if you ask me:- Is there a God, or an Allah..?? I do not have the foggiest idea.. so I leave it to the preachers to make a living....  Donah..//"
