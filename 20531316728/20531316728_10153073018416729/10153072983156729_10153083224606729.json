You are holding back items and just eating away our credits and now charge us for certain power ups that we use to get in game. this is wrong. where is your sense of fair play. No one likes to feel cheated and taken advantage of. I just lost of 600 credits today trying to get one of 3 items I need in a room and won nothing but the free ones as a shadow or in a chest. that is so wrong BB Come on and be fair."
