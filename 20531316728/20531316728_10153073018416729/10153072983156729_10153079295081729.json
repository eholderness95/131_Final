Click-baiting is when a publisher posts a link with a headline that encourages you to click to see more, without telling them much information about what you will see.

The full headline was: \"Monty Python\u2019s John Cleese: FOX News People Are Too Stupid to Know They Are Stupid (Video).\" The publisher provided a fully descriptive headline. Facebook butchered it to the point where it was almost useless."
