If you'd like to list a second name on your account (ex: maiden name, nickname, professional name), you can add an alternate name to your profile. Learn how at: http://on.fb.me/Z9LA3N. -Sarah"

            "message": "Hola Facebook, I feel like it is unsafe to have to use your real full name, I think a requirement to use your real first name only would make more sense. I have stalkers who knew me from college and other places and they knew my whole name, and some of them, I don't even know their names. I also prefer anonymity when I am debating with people. I don't want those people to know who I really am. It is scary but people can look up your address just by having your name. My name is pretty unique so the danger is higher. Thank you for being understanding and restoring my account when I provided my ID. I hope that my ID is deleted and that I have no identity theft in the future."
