        "message": "sorry from Thailand.\n\nI'm here today not because I'm Thai but we are human of the world.\nWe  want to ask for justice to victims who were murdered in Ko Tao as we \nwant the investigation to be transparent. It's not only that but also \nfor 2 burmese who were tortured to confess.\n\nWe\n don't want to let money become justice and guilty person still live \npeacefully without any charges. We are so desperate from system in the \ncountry,so, we want the world know that there are voices of people that \nwant this case to be cleared. Please help us, please give justice to \nHannah and Justice for Hannah Witheridge and David Miller"
