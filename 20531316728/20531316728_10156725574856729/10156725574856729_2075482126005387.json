Blocks are temporary and can last a few hours or a few days. Please sit tight while the ban is in place. For more information, visit: http://bit.ly/2A27sVR.

That last link that you just shared is to a response portal which I have already used. It doesn't seem to actually serve as an appeal process; it seems to be more of a general feedback so that Facebook can improve. I need to find out why I was blocked. I need someone from Facebook to actually tell me what behavior of mine was inappropriate, lest I repeat it in the future."
