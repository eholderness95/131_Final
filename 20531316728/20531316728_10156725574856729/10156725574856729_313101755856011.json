Check out the complaints all over the Internet, not only civilians, but military members and police officers are also complaining about this. 1 person is report you falsely for \"using a fake name\", they immediately lock your account and ask for ID and other documents to prove your identity. Then they MAY unlock your account, but maybe not.\nI'm not in the military but here is what happened: Facebook locked me out in April, I told them I have a harasser. They did unlock my account in 24 hours. 1 month later they locked me out for good. From may to this day, my main account is locked. 3 weeks ago I gave up and started keep sending them my ID card and other docs, they won't check it. Over 3 weeks now, I'm locked. There are many people Facebook don't answer and unlock, ever. Many of them are military and police. I just read like 2000 complaints on multiple websites, it's shocking. Civilians, military, police, Facebook ignores everyone. :-( \n(PS: This is my 3rd secondary account, since I can't use the main account I had for 5 or so years. FB won't unlock that one, but keeps turning off my secondary accounts. Unfair on every level.)"
