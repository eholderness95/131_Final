I think that when the filter is added as an overlay, your original profile pic is replaced with a new one where the overlay is added, and the result is saved in your profile pics.  You can't go to that pic and edit it to remove the overlay, but you can replace the french flag overlay pic with your original profile pic, which is still in your list of profile photos.  You might have to look over all your profile pics to find the original one you were using."
