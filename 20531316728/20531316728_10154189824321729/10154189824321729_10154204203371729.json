Will the photo you had, before adding the filter, be in amongst your other profile pictures?\nI'm just enquiring before I change as I've noticed alot of people are having issues.. Also, I have the option to change my profile picture to the 'celebrate pride' one but not for the French flag (filters)\nPlease help!! \nThanks in advance :)"
