I'm trying to get tickets, but they are telling me it's not on their schedule.... I told them that I saw it and you told me.. I don't know what the heck they are doing... but I don't know where else to check for this date.. Can you help me with this and then I can send it to them and they can see for them selves...  thank you    Barbara"
