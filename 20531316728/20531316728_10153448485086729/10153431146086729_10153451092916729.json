Yes, it is heartbreaking, but would you rather be blissfully ignorant and do nothing to save the animals from the torture they are going through, or, would you rather be someone who knows what is going on and actually help.  Making the posts disappear does not make the abuse stop, it just hides it like a dirty little secret.   Awareness is KEY! If you don't like to see the sadness, unlike the pages that post them, and stay in your little rose colored glasses world where everything is sunshine and rainbows.  I myself would rather be an advocate and speak up for the ones who have no voice.  I won't let them go unheard or unseen.  They need to be helped not to be ignored, hidden, or removed."
