You can't block Facebook ads entirely. Ads help keep Facebook free and we strive to only show ads that are relevant and interesting to you. -Chantal"

As long as I buy products and services in this life, I'm going to keep my eyes open for choices in which to purchase them. Ads tend to help in this process. \nI do however hope that the space they take up on my page stay on one side and don't keep getting wider. I really don't like them in my news feeds!"
