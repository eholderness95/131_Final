            "message": "Hi , I'm Parker. I've got a story that's pretty cool , a testimony of faith that will set you ablaze , maybe if you let it , I dunno , and I write it because I care about people , you never know what's happening to them , so I comfort them , so here's my testimony that I shall copy and paste 100 times a day 1000 times a week any time I want , all you have to do, is listen , but listen , I've done my homework , I know what I'm talking about , I've compared my story with other story's and discovered that they all had the same things that were similar , I am a certified christian and I read my bible every day , 20 pages day  , so finally I present , to all the Atheists out there  , I love you guys , you're too funny when you debate my story  , so yeah , here it is.\nWhen I was 8 or 9 years old , I was going through a lot in the 4th grade , I was depicted as \"high functioning \" , a really fast thinker , but that was used against me . One day It was as if my brain was talking to me , like I was a schizophrenic or something , I'd have these full conversations with no-one but myself , it was a battle every day for 2 years , if I heard a swear word , my brain would start freeking   out  and just light on fire with speech , I don't know where it came from , or how I developed it , it just came about , I believed in God and thought I had to be perfect and flawless to get to heaven , I had no idea about Jesus , I didn't even know him , I praised God every minute , I was scared of him , I never really felt anything special here and there once in a while but one day , ONE DAY SOMETHING HAPPENED , I was sitting in class one day And I was going on and on and on talking to the voices , do I'm sitting there and I keep talking , then some voice told me to say \"Tell them to go away in Jesus name\" , so I did , for 20 minutes I did that , then all the sudden  I felt like someone took a blanket off of me and I felt light , lighter than before , I searched for the voices but they were nowhere to be found , I had a sound mind .But that wasn't the only thing that happened to me . That night when I went to sleep , something AMAZING HAPPENED , it was 3 in the mourning and I suddenly woke up , as I opened my eyes I felt like I needed to look at the doorway in my room , when I looked over  , I saw him , JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF , looking straight at me , and as I'm sitting there I can feel this love on me , it was the best feeling I had ever felt in my life , pure love , LIQUID LOVE , ohhhhh it was good  , than after I felt that I snapped back into sleep instantly , and as I am asleep after 5 minutes I was suddenly out of my body (in spirit form) and floating above myself , as I am up there I can see my body sleeping peacefully in my bed , huh , pretty cool , I know , but that's nothing compared to what I would experience next , after I was done floating above my body in spirit form , I began to float upward as if something was pulling me inward , then all of the sudden I hit the ceiling ,BOOOM , this bright white light is surrounding me COMPLETLY , all around me , at that moment I had emotions I cannot begin to announce , it was the most powerful thing , it just hits you , then the light slowly disappeared , slowly , as it went away I saw this LARGE gate like a harp kindof , and just like from the bible , it was a silver gate ,(right now I am standing looking about) , I as I am looking at everything that is taking place I can see 10 angels above the gate singing in a chorus together , it was perfect , they were perfect , everything was perfect , so beautiful , they were singing loudly in perfect tone , ohhhh how wonderful it was , and as I am there standing I look to my left and see a man , his silhouette is emitting light , he has a sash and he is standing with his arm above the other in a women like posture , and the thing was , the most important thing about everything that was happening , was that man ( I had no idea who he was) but that man was looking straight at me , he didn't say anything , he just looked at ME ______________ Smiling ________at me_____and I can FEEL it , I knew that that was the most important thing while I was there , I was in that place for 3 minutes , a lot can happen in three minutes , and after it was all over , I snapped back to my body , on earth .  \n a lot can happen in three minutes , and after it was all over , I snapped back to my body , on earth .  \nAs I  am in my body I notice something , someone was in the bed with me , I had no idea what was happening to me , all I knew is that I felt this love I had never experienced before , ever in my life , that same man I saw was in the bed with me , and after about a minute I fell asleep again.  The next day I got up and ran into the living room to watch spongebob squarepants , the room was filled with light , a lot of it , from the sun, and it felt good  , then I asked my mom \"hey\" , Were you sleeping with me last night\" . \"No\" , \"not at all\" , \"why\" she asked, \"huh\" I said. Then I go to my dad and he gave me the same answer , \" No\".  I was clueless \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude27. I had no idea what happened."
