        "message": "It would be nice if facebook allowed us to tag people on our buisness page we aren't friends with. That way we can have a personal facebook page separate from our business life.  It forces us to not share and not post things we may not want clients to read...  Like personal stuff etc...Sometimes clients will tag themselves but often not... I Know I'm not alone in this complaint."
