        "message": "I  need help, I am trying to report someone for stalking. His name is Sean  Michael Lopez. He has two accounts. One is Asmodeous M Lopez and the  other is Sean Michael. Now, this person has made extreme and violent  threats against myself and my husband. He has been stalking me through  both profiles but I could not report his Sean Michael because he blocked  me on that one after I threatened with the police. His Asmodeous is  still visible but there is no option for harassment on there. I need  something done about this. I have msged about being harassed in the past  and for a few years now. Now, either this person gets banned from FB or  I will have to take serious legal action.  \nHis name is: Sean Michael Lopez \nHis birthdate is September 7th 1987 \nAny help on this matter would be greatly appreciated."
