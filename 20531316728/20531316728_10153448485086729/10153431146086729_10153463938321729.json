I tried reporting a page which someone created to impersonate me and all I got was send a message to this person or choose not to see stuff from them. How is it going to stop them from posing as me. Putting up my stolen photos n making people believe it was me. I was harassed by this person but you people did nothing. I'm still being harassed. You need to make your system better."
