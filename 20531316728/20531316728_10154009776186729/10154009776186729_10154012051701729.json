        "message": "Thank you FB for the opportunity to be with my family and friends and FB friends every day to share our feelings, pictures, love and thoughts for one another in all the good, bad, happy and sad, and our differant respect for one another in our hope, faith and love. I love and miss my family so much as we are all scattered so far apart so I thank you FB that because of you we can all communicate as never before when we could only afford to write letters and raarely afford a long distant phone call or visit with limited incomes and very long distances. FB you have been a blessing to me and many and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. <3 :)"
