        "message": "WARNING! Carry on reading! Or you will die, even if you only looked at the word warning! Once there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was \nten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her\nmom and her dad. She got so\nbad she went\nto kill all the staff in the hospital so the More- government decided \nthat best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to \nkill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were \nusing went wrong.\nAnd she sat there in agony for hours until she died. Now every\nweek on the day of her death she returns to the person that\nreads this letter, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps\ninto\nyour room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed \nto death. Now send this to ten other pictures on this one site, and she \nwill haunt someone else who doesn't. This\nisn't fake. apparently, if u copy and paste this to ten comments\nin the next ten minutes u will have the best day of ur life\ntomorrow. u will either get kissed or asked out, if u break this\nchain\nu will see a little dead girl in your room tonight. in 53 mins someone \nwill say i love you or im sorry"
