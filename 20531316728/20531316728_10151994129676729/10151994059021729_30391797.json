It shouldn't matter what others say, you should remain voiceless because you really shouldn't be one to judge others, gays should have their rights even if you are hating on them what happens to be so wrong that you must nag them over and over just imagine if you have loved somebody and you were forced to only be \"friends\" with them your life wouldn't go too smoothly."
