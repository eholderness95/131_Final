Please do the world a favour and delete your Facebook pages, as a matter of fact, delete anything you have with a gay tie-in. You'd be pretty surprised as how many websites are gay friendly. The internet doesn't need you and neither does the rest of the world. Soon you will be the ones that everyone laughs at."
