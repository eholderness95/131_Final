Since you seem to know so much about the Bible, maybe you should actually read it, and study it, before speaking on it's behalf\n\nEven looking at it from a worldly/secular perspective, homosexuality is unnatural, and there are several secular studies showing anticipated negative sociological effects on children as a result.  It doesnt even have a place in the so-called \"evolutionary\" model.  If anything it's a DE-evolution of the human race.  It's nothing more than a trend, and i'm ready for it to be over, so the 98% of the country that ISNT gay can get on with their lives, and don't have to think about disgusting things like this.\n\nI will always speak out against this, so don't think you can silence me. I will not let evil prevail in this country."

BUT, outlawing or socially banning a behaviour only drives it underground. The behaviour does not stop, and you only ostracise the people who need your understanding and love most. They already feel like outsiders, hence the need to stand up for themselves as individuals with rights. I believe in God and the Bible, but I don't want to force my beliefs on others. Allow others to voice their differences and be willing to discuss where you disagree, but the hate for other views and lifestyles only creates more hate. My God does not hate people. I disagree but maybe I'm wrong. What if I'm wrong? Am I perfect? I do not fear discussion. Freedom includes the freedom for us BOTH to be wrong, but not for one of us to force our views on another."
