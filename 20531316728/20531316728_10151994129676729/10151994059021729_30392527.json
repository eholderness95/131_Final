If you believe in God, then you should believe God gave people free choice to do as they wished, and also taught \"judge not lest ye be judged.\" \nHomosexuality is no more a sin than homophobia is, so if all homosexuals are \"going to hell\" then they'll see you narrow-minded, horrible people there too! \nHave a good day! :)"
