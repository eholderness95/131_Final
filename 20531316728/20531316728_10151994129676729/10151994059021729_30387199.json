No, the Bible says \"Whosoever will may come.\" Think of it like this. Your drowning in a sea, and God throws you a rope. He doesnt  make you take it, or force you to beg. It is a choice to accept His gift of grace. And once you do, it isnt a \"submitting to His will\" its a joyous day by day decision to live for His honour and glory. I hope and pray that one day you will experience this for yourself."

Not the grace part but the methods to obtain grace. here's what concerns me. \"God\" creates beings...gives them free will...yet knows their future....continues on anyway knowing which creations will go to \"hell\".So a person can live their entire life in good graces...a caring and loving soul...devoting his or her life to the progress and beauty of others...but be refused into heaven because of a sexual preference? They were born the way they are...in so...they were purposely given life to be sinful? I do not believe an all loving God would have selective love. I know how painful it is for me to carry around hate for a day...to miss an entire day being bitter and spiteful. If \"God\" disagreed tot his ...why not fix it now? :s People who are gay suffer...not all of them but many of them do. Why condemn someone to wake up everyday and question their existence...beg God to change them yet they remain who they ARE? Maybe hate is a human condition..and not a divine one? I don't know...All I mean to say is maybe we shouldn't speak for a God who isn't speaking for his/herself. I am not saying God does or doesn't exist...I wouldn't know...all I mean to imply is that maybe this isn't as big of a concern to \"God\" as it is to some members of the human race.
