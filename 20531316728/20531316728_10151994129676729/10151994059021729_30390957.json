        "message": "I respect everyone regardless of there beliefs and sexual preferences. I may not agree with you but it is not it is not my place to judge. I a firm believer in Jesus Christ. I will say: straight ppl don't have parades or a special day. I feel often times things taken to the extreme. Personally I feel if we are going to walk/ raise money let's put it towards curing diseases, helping those with special needs, and etc. I feel most of our nation focuses on there own self ambition and not on how we can help make our nation a better place."
