        "message": "Well done facebook! I think it's great that you show your support to the LGBTQ community.\nAs for a lot of the negative comments here I will sum up some of the reflections I\u2019ve done:\n1)\tFor those of you who invoke the bible quotes of a marriage being between a man and a woman. I want you to consider this verse:  Deuteronomy 22:28-29 NLT \n\n\n\nIf a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.\n\nIs this still your idea of a legit marriage?\n\n2)\tFor those of you who scream for a straight pride parade: Well, go ahead, last I checked no one was stopping you, I\u2019m straight myself and if you want to celebrate our way of life you have my blessing. That shouldn\u2019t stop us from letting the LGBTQs celebrate their way of life. Live and let live I say!\n3)\tFor those of you who want to delete your facebook page because of this: Well, again, please be my guest. No one is forcing you to use this service provided by the good folks of facebook, I\u2019d say you are more than welcome to try your fortunes elsewhere, happy hunting for a social network that fit you!\n4)\tFor those of you who say that we\u2019re here to populate the earth: Well, we\u2019re already over populated so I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty good that some of us don\u2019t and rather choose to adopt some of the abandoned children in this world and focus on giving them good lives instead.\n\nAs a final note, remember that giving other people rights doesn\u2019t take away your rights. If LGBTQ people can marry that doesn\u2019t automatically mean that you can\u2019t get married, it only means that both of you can get married, so you go right ahead and marry whoever you want and let them do the same. It\u2019s actually quite simple when you think about it\u2026"
