The Bible was written by men, not God, and I would love to bet that some of them were gay but kept it very quiet :) There are far more than four gospels written, but only four were printed in the bible. There is a gospel of Mary Magdalen but that doesn't get mentioned much because the men that wrote the bible had to keep it quiet that Mary was Jesus favourite disciple! They filled people's heads with fear of God to keep them from getting above their station and thinking for themselves. Nothing much has changed where Christians are concerned eh! Still as ignorant as ever. Jesus said LOVE ONE ANOTHER'. This means that all you Christians who have left negative comments and put downs about gay people are not living as you should! You are all hiding behind your so called Christian beliefs but pick and choose which ones to bully others with. Get back into your caves and examine your own lives, look at where you have gone wrong before judging others, you hypocrites."
