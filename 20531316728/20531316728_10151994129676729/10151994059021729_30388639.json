They were all quoting the bible, but did they consider that maybe, and just maybe, that not all people are Christians? And even if they are, the bible never said anything about gay marriage being a sin, however there were very much which indicated gayness in it. It\u2019s all about how you interpret it. But do you know what the bible says? It says that you may not mix two fabrics. So if you\u2019re wearing denim and cotton, it\u2019s a sin. It says that you may never have sex before marriage, and I\u2019m pretty sure almost everybody nowadays does. So don\u2019t go in and quote the bible when it\u2019s convenient for you, you hypocrites. My mother does not like \u201cgay\", not the people, but the sexuality. Do you know what she does? Nothing. Because as long as SHE isn\u2019t gay, she pretty much don\u2019t care about what other people do. And that comes from a woman who was raised in a strict Islamic home. So if you dislike gay marriage so much, don\u2019t get one, simple as that."
