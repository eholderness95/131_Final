It said follow the law of the land but more importantly follow God's law.\nStephen, that's just false, the U.S. is highly religious and has great standard of living when compared to most of the rest of the world.\nHanyewi, you called me \"delusional and extremely ignorant of history\" which isn't very nice. I don't think there's any way you can justify the delusional part, but how am I ignorant of history?"
