I know many gay and lesbian people and they know how to behave properly and with dignity in the public eye. What a person does sexually should be their private moments not a public display. My wife and I do not put on a performance in public and we expect the same courtesy from the gay community. I do not encourage hate towards gays and feel they should have all the rights heterosexuals do. I do not support Christian Church adoption of gay marriage but if gays get married in a civil way that is okay."
