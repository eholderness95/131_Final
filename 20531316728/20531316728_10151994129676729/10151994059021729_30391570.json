What gives you the right to judge how your fellow humans should live their lives. Here in the Netherlands gays have as many rights as any other inhabitant would have. We do not enforce each other's believes on one another. The mere fact that what you think is true or right doesn't give you the right to judge people who chose how to live their lives differently!"
