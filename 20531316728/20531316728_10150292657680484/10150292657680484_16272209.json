        "message": "Facebook Admins, Moderators, Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz, Sheryl Sandberg, and Matt Cohler;\n\nAlthough you have attended the world's best communication skills courses you have been most successful in growing great hatred and hostility between you and Muslims around the world, but seriously this time you have caused an almost unrepairable damage.\n\nOnly a few weeks after your irresponsible behavior during the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day events you most aggressively removed four of the largest Islamic Facebook Pages of total fans/likes over 2.5 million Facebook members. That happened on the morning of Thursday 8th July, 2010.\n\nThese four Facebook pages were totally peaceful and free of any hate speech, but you removed it ignoring the feelings of more than 2.5 Million Facebook Muslims and disrespecting over 1.5 Billion Muslims worldwide.\n\nAnd now since that is what it had come down to you, with your irresponsibility and fake preach of freedom of speech, have left us no other choice other than permanently boycotting Facebook. And now we are giving you a 2 weeks notice - ending at midnight of 21st July, 2010 - to fulfill our demands or else we will leave Facebook for http://madina.com/.\n\nOur demands are:\n\n1- Reactivating the four pages that have been disabled\n2- Adding a Facebook Term that illegalizes disrespecting Islamic religious symbols\n3- Disabling any Facebook Page, Group, or Event that shows direct or indirect disrespect towards Islamic religious symbols\n\nThe pages that were unfairly removed are:\n\nFacebook.com/Rassoul.Allaah - About 1,600,000 Likes\nFacebook.com/Logo.Ramadan - About 600,000 Likes\nFacebook.com/Love.Mohammed - About 200,000 Likes\nFacebook.com/Quran.Lovers - About 70,000 Likes"
