My father passed away last year at the age of only 45 in July because he lost his battle with Lukiemia and aplastic anemia. We have been battling with his girlfriend ever since. The one thing his family and friends was left with was his Facebook page. An now she's shut that down to. She has no rights to do this. It's all we jave left of him. Please is there any way we can turn his page back on and memorialize it an change his password or something, anything other then what she has. I can send you my birth certificate and everything proving I'm his daughter. Please please please, it's heart breaking enough losing him to lukiemia and all within 3 months of finding out his diagnosis. Please help my family. His name is Kelly A. Poulin, I'm in therapy because of everything going on. I just want to look at my father's pictures once in a while and his posts to remember him."
