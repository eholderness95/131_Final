        "message": "I have a FB for my home business...Memories to Music. Is there a way to use a video for my cover photo? I tried following these directions but I am stumped. My cover only allows for a photo o add or change your Page's cover video:\n\n    Go to your Page.\n    Click Add a Cover in the top left of your cover photo or video.\n    Select Upload Photo/Video to upload a video from your computer, or select Choose From Videos to use a video you've already uploaded to your Page. Keep in mind your cover video should be at least 820 x 312 pixels and between 20 and 90 seconds. For best results, choose a video that's 820 x 456.\n    Select the video from either your computer or your existing videos.\n    After the video has uploaded, reposition the video by clicking it and dragging it up or down, then click Next.\n    Click the arrows to scroll through up to 10 thumbnail options for your cover video. The thumbnail image may be used when someone hovers over your Page's name to get more context about your Page.\n    Click Publish."
