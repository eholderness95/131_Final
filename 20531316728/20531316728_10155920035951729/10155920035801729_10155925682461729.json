        "message": "Facebook, one of the updates created a glitch to groups and pages and is really inconvenient to a lot of your followers. Is there someway I can relay this issue to the right people? I think the overall Facebook experience would improve for a lot of people.  As a group administrator of multiple pages, I would personally love to see this resolved asap. Thank you."
