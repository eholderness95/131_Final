I clicked a link on the log on page which explained that my account had been disabled because Facebook had deemed it a fake account and that I had violated the terms and conditions. I found an appeals email address and just got a reply saying that I have \"reached them at a channel they do not support\". There was no warning, no emails, no notifications to say I'd been reported or anything like that. No help for genuine cases like myself and so many others I've seen. So much for using social media for marketing... All I want to know is did I do something wrong and can I get my page"
