The latter does not.\n\nIn this case, gif is pronounceable (one way or the other), so we can choose to treat it as a word.\n\nOn the other hand PNG is not natively pronounceable in English, so the norm world be to state the letters. Despite this norm, a common pronunciation I have heard (and use myself) is ping."
