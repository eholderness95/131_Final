        "message": "That would be like asking how do you pronounce the \"C\" in \"City\". It makes the \"S\" sound so why not use \"S\" ? but yet the \"C\" in \"Cut\" makes the \"K\" sound. They use \"K\" in \"Kite\".... why not use \"C\" in place of \"K\"? Who makes up all these rules on what letter is used in a word or how the sound of the letter changes its sound in a word? They say it's \"I\" before \"E\" except after \"C\"... why not just spell it as it sounds, \"reseve\" instead of \"receive\" ?"
