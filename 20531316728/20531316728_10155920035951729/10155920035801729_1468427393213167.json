I would like for someone to explain why or how my post violated your community standards!\n And PLEASE, before you give me some canned response from your common reply suggestions please read on!\nI have read your \"community standards\" many times as I am an admin on a hunting page. We get harassed by anti hunters who barrage our page and page members with foul language laced threats of violence and death threats to the hunter AND their families!\n When I report the harassment I get a reply stating that their actions do not violate your \"community standards\"!\nSo I would like to know how my post containing a photo of a legally harvested animal by a hunter in another country managed to violate that same \"community standards\" that allows foul language laced death threatening harassment!\n\nIf you can not provide \"additional details\" I would like to be directed to someone who can!"
