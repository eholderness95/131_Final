        "message": "New FB app glitch, when you like a page and a bunch of related pages appear underneath as suggestions, if you hit like on any of those suggested pages, the app instantly kicks you out as if you had exited out of the app yourself, I'm not sure if FB checks their app updates for glitches BEFORE releasing them but I'm getting really tired of updating the FB app only to find out that every update contains a new glitch."
