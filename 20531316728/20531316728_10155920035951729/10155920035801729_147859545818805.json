I recently unblocked my boyfriend, it\u2019s been over a week, and NEITHER of us can send friend requests to each other. Facebook is how we connect with each other and both of our families and I need this problem resolved ASAP. I reported an issue over a year ago that still has yet to be reviewed. Is this the type of customer service that Facebook has? I\u2019ve even sent a message to this page that hasn\u2019t been opened and posted a question to the community. NOTHING."
