You are looking into this way too hard, it's just an acronym, and how I pronounce it is my choice.\n\nI know how it 'should' be pronounced, but I've always said it with a hard G- it's got nothing to do with logic or whatever. Just 12-year old me pronouncing it that way, and so 18-year old me now will continue to say it that way. \n\nI can't believe I have to explain why I pronounce a three-letter acronym to some stranger."
