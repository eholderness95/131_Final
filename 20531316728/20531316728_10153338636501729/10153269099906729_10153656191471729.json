We have been friends since 10 years old so we are both now 63 we are still the same people but grew up togather been through weddings & funerals & argued like sisters & made up & NOW we just flow & talk of memories & laugh at our imperfections. STILL talk the way we always have. We know each other without even talking. We talk every day or every other day & will spend time this summer togather so at 63 we are friends 53 years."
