        "message": "I think you guys should change it to stay at \"Most recent\" in news feed so promoters actually have a chance to be seen better. They should have thr option to change it to \"Top stories\" instead of \"Most Recent\" i think it was easier when Facebook was more towards \"Most Recent\" friendly. :) \n\nPlease consider this -Brandon"

Top Stories is the result of our findings, which is why it is the default. We know that some people prefer the Most Recent view, so we've kept this option available. If you have specific thoughts you want to share, please let us know here: http://on.fb.me/1rmVirO -Hailey"
