        "message": "I was thinking of something and thought to share it with you and see if you can consider it as an option on Facebook. \n\nSince, I Love music and really enjoy sharing it with others I thought that would've been great if I could have this option that when ever someone is viewing my Facebook page the music I want to share or I'm into in that specific moment or even matches the story that I'm sharing on my wall or with my cover and profile pic, could play on the background and I could change it whenever I want or if the person didn't like it he could pause it. I think that would've been great and I'm sure many people would like that. and since you can't find all music you like in only one site then that could be even better if you could share it from any site like Youtube  or Soundcloud and so on. I hope you can consider that too.. thanks and I love Facebook. :)"
