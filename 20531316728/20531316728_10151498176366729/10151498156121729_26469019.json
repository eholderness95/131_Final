        "message": "Its a pity that Facebook didnt get regular users to do these articles. After all the public faces need facebook more than facebook needs theme. I would probably be right to say that most of the people featured have marketing companies manage there profile/like/group pages and have very little input. And its likely that most of the advertising (facebooks objective) As well as connecting the world ( I am grateful) These people dont even click on. So why the show of so many celebs and public figures.?"
