        "message": "This is really great.  But I want to point out that there are lots of people in rural United States who do not have satisfactory access to broadband internet, such as where I am in northern lower peninsula of Michigan.  There is no cable or DSL where I live in the country -- that's only in towns.  Our choices are satellite or wireless, and they are very expensive for high data usage (and I don't even mean watching full length movies -- I mean more routine internet uses).  Encourage the federal government to bring inexpensive broadband to the hinterland, just like the rural electrification project."
