        "message": "I got my first computer in 2011. Access to the internet has opened up a whole world of information that I never had before. As a woman living in rural Montana, I have learned more these last 4 years than in my whole life previous to that, including my school years. Through Facebook, I have become acquainted with people from all over the world. Some of them, who live in rural India, would have no education if it weren't for the internet and Wikipedia. But the internet isn't all good. It is being used for surveillance, and what we say and what we do is all monitored and collected. Emails are not private, nor is Facebook. Speech is controlled, in some cases. Still, I believe that the internet belongs to and should be accessible to everyone. In light of that, I will support this effort."
