        "message": "#ZEOZ said no more unemployment/ no more job seeking. I was about to lost my life back in 2013-14. The only person helped me at that time is my elder brother Nagi (God bless him). Taught me about life showed me how much I am blessed and how wonderful it is. What I have done with it and how I have spoiled it with my so-called friends. Nagi (God bless him) grabbed my hand and pulled me out from the disgraceful life; the disrespectable world I choose for myself. I was silent and quite got tears in my eyes he said to be thankful to your God and try to help others. Don't embrace your life and me again. I am helping others with #Zeoz aka employment for unemployment. Business opportunity with 0 investment. You want to work please work with your people; friends and family. If they believe you other will do the same. Use this app for communication please professional communication. \nOne day we all will eat tasty/healthy/wealthy food with our friends and families."
