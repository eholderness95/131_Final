        "message": "Facebook, my account is under my husband Harold Leacock. My page has me in the 60s with black band behind me.  There is another page which should not be with me in a dress.  Went to Verizon to take off and thought they deleted.  Found out still there.  My singing partner Michael Roldon tried to be my friend and showed that page with me in a dress, so please take that account off.  Someone using our account and are we paying for that.  Please help.  Sincerely, darlene Leacock."
