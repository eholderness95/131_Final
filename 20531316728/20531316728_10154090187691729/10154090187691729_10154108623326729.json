        "message": "WHY are you guys controlling my privacy on my Timeline? ... in order for me to highlight something on my timeline, I gotta make it public. But I only want friends to see. Why on earth would you do this? I don't need my stalker ex who creates random profiles stalking who I'm with and causing issues. Please set it back to where I can see it highlighted on my profile for friends to see and not have to force putting it public. smh. I mean, think of the big picture. Not in my situation...but think in dangerous high profile situations. Someone could get murdered/hurt. Then there would be lawsuits drawn up. We should be able to have the freedom to use social media freely without having to feel paranoid. Think of the big picture next time. Please..........."
