        "message": "HELLO FACEBOOK! i have a great idea that can help many people that use facebook in better ways! I like many pages on facebook, that share a lot of nice articles and stuff, bot most of the time i only save it (much more easy to save on facebook than on my browser) because i don't have the time to read, it but know that when time comes it will be useful. The big PROBLEM arrives when im looking trough hundreds of links to find the one article i remember that i saved it. Can u develop a search field, where i can search after the article i saved months ago?? in that way i don't need to save on my computer, or use google all the time. Know that this is something many will find genious! sorry bout my english Uttrykksikonet tongue"
