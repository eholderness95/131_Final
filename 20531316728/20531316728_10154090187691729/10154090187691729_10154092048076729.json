        "message": "Dear Mark and the team\n\nFantastic move, bravo!! Back in 1992 my 12-year old sister Hana was put on one of the last UN evacuation busses to flee our besieged home-city of Sarajevo. I was 22 at the time, and I stayed behind to look after our five younger siblings. Back then we had no Internet or mobile phones and aside from Red Cross massaging system, which was slow and unreliable, there was no way of communicating. It took almost 6 months to find out that Hana had made it safely to Croatia and it was another 2 years before we got re-united. They were terrible, dark times. Information about the whereabouts of family and friends in times of turmoil is crucial and we applaud you for your initiative http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34373389     Best wishes Atka and Hana"
