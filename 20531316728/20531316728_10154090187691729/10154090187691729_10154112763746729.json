        "message": "Dear Facebook,\n I will be as polite as I can be although I'm absolutely furious. There is an account that was created specifically to bully my girlfriend. The fake account is telling my girlfriend to kill herself and spreading horrible things to people in our community. But there's NO WAY TO REPORT THE ACCOUNT. All it says when I hit report account for harassment and being fake is to block the fake account. PLEASE HELP BEFORE THIS TURNS INTO SOMETHING LEGAL."
