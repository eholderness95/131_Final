        "message": "Hi, as I'm sure you're aware, there's a major refugee crisis taking place in Europe and the Middle East. Tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of refugees are trying to reach safety using any means possible. Among those seeking asylum in Europe, one of the major problems is the absolute information vacuum in which everything happens. A lot of those people do have smartphones, but they rarely have the opportunity to recharge their batteries and even then there's little to no network coverage which means no internet access. With the means a company like Facebook can unleash this could change.. please please consider it. It would be beyond amazing and it would help a LOT of people."
