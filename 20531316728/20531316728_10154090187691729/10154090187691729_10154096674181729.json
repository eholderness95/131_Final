I reported that someone is harrassing me on fb messages I have anxiety and i'm always shaking when i'm seeing that message! And why is that you are collecting people's post and if u get arrested law inforcement can check your profile and use it against you?! you can say anything u want doesn't mean you are actually doing it. So now Fb tell me please why can't you help ordinary people?? Or your focus is only for business owners, entrepreneurs and law inforcement"
