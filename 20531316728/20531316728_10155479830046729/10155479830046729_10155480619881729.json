        "message": "I'm back once again!  So let's talk about the feature OnThisDay. I've sent in several examples via Facebook Messenger and no one bothers to respond to them.  I had this feature for couple of days last year and Facebook took it away. But in 2016 Facebook announced a global roll out of this feature.   I've even sent in a ticket to look into this and just get a canned message and then it gets closed.  I would be happy if I was told an ETA on when I would get the feature.
