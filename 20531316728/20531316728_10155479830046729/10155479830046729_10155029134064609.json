        "message": "I am upset because fb removed a post that in no way was offensive. I know your standards and yet it was removed and I said nothing wrong. It was the unfairness that upsets. I have reported posts before that have violated standards yet they never get removed and I am told repeatedly they don't violate standards. Someone needs to get their priorities straight. I am truly disappointed."
