I had a situation with a person who I got to know for 5 months he came out about a few days ago and said he was a scammer and was sorry I had never given him money nor personal info but I guess getting to know me made him feel guilty. I didn't know if I should report it as he never asked me for money or asked me for personal things only that he said he was. let me know what you think is best. god bless you ty again ryan"
