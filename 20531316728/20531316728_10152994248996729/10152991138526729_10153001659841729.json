        "message": "Facebook allowed a video of two dead women who died in a graphic car accident with severed limbs getting looted on film while people just watched in a third world country and wouldn't remove it. I quoted my favorite line in a movie on a post asking what your favorite part part of the film was and someone got so offended by the movies use of a homophobic slur, when I was reported, Facebook immediately suspended my account for 12 hours. Maybe I'm just a little crazy, but I think seeing a graphically severed,real life corpse being violated is far worse than the word I used which was a quote from a film that I did not use in any way to harass anyone. In much less words, review your reports better Facebook!"
