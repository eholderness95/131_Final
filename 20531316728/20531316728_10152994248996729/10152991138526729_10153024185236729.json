        "message": "Facebook, look it is really annoying for your company to change my newsfeed to top stories when i want most recent.  also I find it most irritating that if i don't want to see a story in my close friends feed and click i don't want to see or hide all from XYPERsONYADA then I have to go back and delete it again or give a reason.  the reason why i dont want to see something is my business and not yours.  so stop changes things.  facebook has gotten so unuser friendly and its only according to facebook, not its users.  i liked old facebook.  I can't stand timeline and i can't stand having to look at picture at the top of my feeds for close friends or any friends list.  can't you come up with a page like baby pages for all the people that constantly post pages on here or better yet a link for videos.  you have everything else under the sun make a link to video and hide them there. OK?!?!!!"

Top Stories is the result of our findings, which is why it is the default. We know that some people prefer the Most Recent view, so we've kept this option available. We're constantly working to improve Facebook for everyone and if you have specific thoughts you want to share, please let us know at: http://on.fb.me/1r7Lkcq. -Jenny"
