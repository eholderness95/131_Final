        "message": "It's ridiculous that it's come to this. I pay my service provider for unlimited talk and text. I don't need assistance from Facebook in my text messaging.  And as far as all the hoopla about Facebook turning on the mic or camera goes,  Facebook is a liberal/left website.  Most people who actually keep up with all that know that liberals lie. So for me it all just goes in one ear and out the other. I realize that everyone doesn't lie about everything but these days people need to stick to what I was always taught,  \"only believe half of what you see and nothing of what you hear\" and you'll be alright."
