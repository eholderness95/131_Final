        "message": "Well, this isn't really the appropriate spot, but you have no other way of getting someone to deal with your error.....Please see below...posted 9/1.. Also sent message to FB....no response....Now you have officially taken my money.       So..... I have forever been a FB member. I have forever had a credit card attached to my account for GAMES. FB has taken it upon itself to add that credit card info to two other accounts that I created for Non-Profits in Town and then start Ads for one these. The money is being taken from my private funds. There are no funds for these Non-Profits. Currenlty they have 78.85 of my money.\n\nI did not give them permission to do this. I now cannot remove the credit card info from my personal account as they say it is linked to the other Ads account....Ads account I did not want, need or authorize. What I do want is my money back ASAP AND my credit card info removed IMMEDIATELY.\n\nSHAME ON FACEBOOK!!!!!!!!!\n\nI want to be contacted by FB immediately!!!!"
