        "message": "Please, stop forcing the \"Messenger\" app on your costumers.\n\nWhen you first started announcing the launch of this app, I ignored it. I enjoyed using the built-in messaging system rather than a whole separate app.\nI've been following the app's reviews for months and you can clearly see your costumers aren't very pleased with how you're forcing this app on us... I've read far more negative reviews, than positive.\n\nToday there was no way around the message regarding messenger. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't get around it.\nThis has resulted in me becoming extremely dissatisfied.\n\nIf this app remains mandatory, I'm quite certain I'll stop using Facebook.\nUp until now, I've been using Facebook on a daily basis. I'm also a paying costumer.\nNow I've ignored my messages on Facebook, and I've had people move over to other social medias to communicate with me.\n\nLong story short: Make the \"messenger\" app OPTIONAL or you can sit back and watch your members leave."
