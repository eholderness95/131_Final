However, I think some improvements need to be made on the app.  My phone used to last through my entire work day and then some without needing a charge.  Soon I found I could barely get through 6 hours without the battery dying.  Why?  Because Messenger was taking up almost 50% of my battery usage and draining my battery faster than anything else running on my phone.  I uninstalled it for now because I shouldn't have to keep my phone plugged in all day at work because Messenger is constantly on, running, and using battery time even when I want it (or try to) turn it off."
