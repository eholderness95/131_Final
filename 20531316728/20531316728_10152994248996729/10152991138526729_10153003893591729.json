We know there's been a lot of false and scary information going around about permissions\u2014just to be clear, we don't turn on your camera or microphone when you aren't using the app. Learn more about how we actually use permissions for Messenger: http://on.fb.me/1qipTI7. -Natalie"

The fact that the YouTube implement requires just about all of my personal information and that all information is overshared with advertisers lays that idea to rest. \"If you want to use the basic functions of this ubiquitous app, give us your soul. Or, if you desire to remain excluded from what are now essential functions, deny permissions.\" The conspiracy theories are needless when the reality itself is ridiculous."
