            "message": "TRUTH: facebooks review system is mostly automated. If enough people spam the report buttons on enough posts of one person that persons account will be automatically disabled with nary a person on facebooks side actions to be accounted for. For example during 'flame wars' where one group hates another group they will often gather and report that persons page or group until face book bans his group, page, or the user himself just due to the amount of reports their automated system filed away. This is also an interesting way to get rid of reviews you don't like. For example despite not actually violating any of FB TOS two of my reviews, they wouldn't say which ones, where removed from face book and i was warned i could get banned. reminder, i didn't do anything to warrent having my reviews revoked, they where fair and truthfull and full of information, however either enough people got together to misuse the report buttons OR a powerful enough entity leaned on facebook, i'd wager it's the former."
