It's not only that but also for 2 burmese who were tortured to confess.\nWe don't want to let money become justice and guilty person still live peacefully without any charges. We are so desperate from system in the country,so, we want the world know that there are voices of people that want this case to be cleared. Please help us, please give justice to Hannah and DavidWe want the right justice.\n#justice #kotao #thailand"
