The reason messenger needs Photos, is so that you may send pictures to friends through messenger. Personal texts? I don't know of. Videos? Same as sending pictures. You activate it as choice when you send a picture or video by choice. Besides. They don't look through it. Same as microphone. You activate by pressing the record voice on the chat. Hopefully this helped? Or maybe it won't. Either way, I'm just trying to help a few people. ^_^"
