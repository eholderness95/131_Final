        "message": "We're launching 360 video on Facebook. To create 360 videos, a special set of cameras are used to record 360 degrees of a scene simultaneously. So when you watch 360 videos on Facebook, you can choose what angle you want to see it from. \nStarting today, you'll be able to view these videos on the web or on Android devices. We plan to roll this out for iOS devices in the coming months. We hope you enjoy this immersive view of the Jakku desert from Star Wars."
