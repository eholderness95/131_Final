If your account doesn't have a blue verified badge, there are other ways to help let people know that you're authentic. For example, you can link to your Facebook profile or Page from your official website, Instagram profile or Twitter account. You can learn more about Page verification here: http://bit.ly/2lTCpQm. -Elizabeth"
