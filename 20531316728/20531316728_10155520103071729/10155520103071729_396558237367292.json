Ever since I sent in my ID, I only get the message \"we are verifying your ID and will let you know when it's verified\" \nIs something wrong with the process?   How long does or can it take to confirm that ID and account are authentic.    This is a little concerning to me since I sent my full Picture ID in to you guys without covering anything.    I'm very worried since I haven't had not one update.    Please advise \ud83d\ude4f\n\nThanks in advance"
