If your account is currently locked, you can try to get access by logging into your account and trying to complete the security check from the computer or mobile phone that you usually use to log into Facebook. Unfortunately, if you're unable to log in and complete the security check on your own, you'll have to send us an acceptable form of ID. Learn more: http://bit.ly/2mN7Uka. -Jessica"
