Since we enter Facebook giveaways, and these are often limited in the timeframe in which you can enter, often they are over before I even get the post! But yet you junk up my feed with tons of non-relevant to me advertising and other things that have nothing to do with what my friends are posting.  I am not the Facebook trashbin.  If you have an ad, put it in the sidebar (I do click what is interesting to me)."
