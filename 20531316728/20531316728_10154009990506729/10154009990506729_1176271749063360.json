        "message": "This photo is the sixth grade birthday which would make ole David 12 years old......Just by luck and gracious love David's Mom was my sixth grade teacher and his Dad was the veteran track coach at Vista High School for the duration of his career.....Vista and Oceanside where David and I went cause we lived in Oceanside was real bitter sports enemies back in the mid seventies ....Now both cities are very pretty much merged partners who are frequently the best athletes in the entire San Diego landscape......No doubt the toughest, most intelligent team togetherness out of all the districts.....This has been proven time after time so this isn't just a boastful remark......And what's the frosting on the cake is all these talented individuals go on to either Mira Costa Community College or Palomar J.C. where they become likely professionals if there dream continues to take them there......The opportunities were endless and I didn't even realize it even though my late Father was the founding President of MCC.....I  know now cause after physically and choosing to be a member of other communities I truly tasted the different  geographical sites first hand......Honestly the North San Diego County ranks in my opinion as the foremost place to live and produce the dream coming true......This is the result of anyone who refuses to use or even try to succeed......I know cause I certainly can't do it all other again so to anyone who even takes a grain of sand with my advise  I suggest to get a pro coach and do the groundwork with your ultimate goals in life and do NOT deter from it.....Simple as this sounds even the best athlete in the world has to stay focused and determined to keep on the set path or all hell will and has break lose at who knows what unpredictable disaster quagmire mess......"
