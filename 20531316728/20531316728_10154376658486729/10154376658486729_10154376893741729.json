        "message": "Because of Facebook, I found the most amazing man who is now my husband! We went to high school together, and although we knew who each other were, we never actually met until a year after high school. He talked to me at a party and gave me a kiss, which was interrupted by a helicopter shining its light down on the party probably to break it up. He went back to college and soon became a father and was married more than once, with 3 beautiful children. Decades later we became facebook friends (along with everyone else from high school). Occasionally we commented on each others posts. He even called me sexy once back in 2010. We shared views on things that were important to us and there was an attraction. Finally one night, February 24, 2012, i saw he had a \"green dot\" on chat. (I had been stood up for a movie date that night and was just sitting at home  feeling a little down) I remembered the time he wrote \"sexy\" on my photo, and I decided to say \"hi\"... That began a conversation that never ended. Exactly 3 months later, I moved across country from Arizona back to my home town Kansas City, Missouri! We got married this past September \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc70\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc95. In a few weeks it will be 4 years ago that we started that chat on facebook that changed our lives forever! Thank you Facebook \ud83d\udc97"
