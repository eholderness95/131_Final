So people that I loved and missed and thought were gone forever, thanks to you Facebook I am again keeping up with my family and friends. Good job. Thank you, keep up the good work and caring for your people and I can say for what you have done to help me find so many people that are so important to me, I guess you can say that makes Facebook my best friend. Happy Friendship Day to all of you, and thank you all.God  Bless You Facebook."
