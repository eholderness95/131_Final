        "message": "Thanks facebook for making it possible for my deceased son to come back to me on the cross in 3 segments as Jesus on the cross and I know it sounds wild but however, you just haven't heard the real story behind it, if only you knew the whole story you would understand and also my sister-in-law, Barbara Davis and I have a beautiful relationship since I joined Facebook this coming June will be 2yrs. ago. I must not leave out my daughters friends she made when she lived in Chicago a yr. ago because they are all my friends now and also old friends from my past are just a click away and now I can say I am living the good life in the real world,thanks to Facebook."
