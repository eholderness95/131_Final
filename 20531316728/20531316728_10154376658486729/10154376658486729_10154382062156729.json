        "message": "It's a shame you have a company this big with no customer support and no customer service. People are writing bad reviews about you all over the Internet, social media and Instagram being one of them.  One of the main reasons is that you block someone's account asking them to prove their identity and even after they send you 8 official documents proving their identity you still fail to unblock their account and respond to them. We have used all the tools that Facebook offers and have sent in emails and appeals and as of today the ac oh t has not been restored. \nThis gentleman is a former politician, he has over 200k followers. It's obviously not a fake account."
