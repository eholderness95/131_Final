        "message": "My dad had his account - Hoody Crow removed twice now. He uses facebook to stay in contact with others with the same illness as him. Hoody Crow is his preferred name but it is not his legal name. I have sent numerous messages without a response as well as many other people all advocating for him. He has sent documentation that it is his preferred name and yet you guys do nothing.  I am saddened that there are so many fake account out there and you guys can't reinstate the account of one old man that uses facebook for it's intended purposes. Nor can you respond to even one person that has emailed you (and there have been dozens of us.)"
