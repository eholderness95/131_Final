        "message": "Hi. Without appearing to be negative I would like to point out something that is particularly irritating when scrolling the comments on something I posted on the news line. If the cursor comes in contact with the name of the commenter, suddenly a popup of that person's home page covers what I'm trying to read. If that was not irritating enough, the popup won't go away until you move the cursor all over the place and finally the popup goes away. It's not a real bad problem but it is infuriating when you just want to read the comments and get on with your life. I hope you stop the automatic popups. Please. :)"
