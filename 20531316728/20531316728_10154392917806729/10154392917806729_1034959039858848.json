I have listed it as a Secret Group and I have given the URL for ones in the other group to join. They say that \"This content is currently not available\" when they click on the link. I do not know how to fix this. Can you please help me. Your help center does not contain any information that I can find. I am new at this so I could be going about this the wrong way. I would appreciate your assistance. Thank You :*"
