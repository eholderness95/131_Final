I keep reporting them to Facebook because the pictures are all stolen from russian and polish dating and model sites. (google image to the resque) they all just made the account, and have like 1 or 2 poor guys who fell for it, and list high education and living in that town. is there any way facebook can stop this? thru checking if multibla accounts are from same IP etc?"
