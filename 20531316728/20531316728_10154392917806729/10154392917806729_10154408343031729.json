            "message": "I am trying to get some help on a billing question, but the feature to \"click\" on the \"Email\" button is NOT working:\nI have questions about charges in my account.\nIt's common to see multiple charges throughout the month. You\u2019re billed when the total cost of all ads you are running hits a specific dollar threshold .If you don\u2019t hit the threshold, you\u2019re billed at the end of the month. For example, if you have a billing threshold of $25 and spent $47 on 3 different ads this month, you'll see two charges for $25 and $22. The first is when you've hit your billing threshold, the second is the end of month charge. \nYou can always find your final, detailed bill in the Billing section of your Ads Manager.\nIf that didn't answer your question, please select \"Other\" in the section above to reach out to us. We're always happy to help!\nEmail Support (NOT working)\nI want to take care of my $6.51 balance, but I also want to be sure i am NO longer charged.    How can I reach someone????\n\nI paid  $10 on Dec. 27th, and add to end on Jan. 3\nYet, I was charged $6.51 on Feb 2, which the charge didn't go through due to having to change my cc # because of fraud.\nI don't know what I was charged one month after my \"end\" date, and why $6.51, that is MORE than half of what I requested on Dec. 27th.  So why weren't the charges taken out during the PROMO time period.  \nI don't think that I owe this fee."

So not sure where this $6.51 charge came from.  Can you please just wipe the slate clean.    I will NOT be doing any more promo boosts on any of my pages, and they have done nothing for my businesses as all anyway.  \nI would like to know that this is resolved and that I am in good standing with Facebook."
