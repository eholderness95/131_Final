        "message": "I wish I could disable the \"suggested pages\" part of your site. I just got a page for a health/beauty page that had a fetish photograph, complete with nudity, on my home page. So glad my little kids weren't with me at the time. Who can I report this to? Also, I have tried messaging your page with a warning about a sexually explicit image sent by FB to a friend who had sent out too many messages. It was part of a security collage featuring cats. Ahem. Although amusing, it can be inappropriate in certain cases. Thanks."
