Someone just sent me a message that because facebook is nearly overpopulated, facebook is now testing everybody if they were active or not and that is to pass the chain message to 25 users before 8:12 this evening. Everyone who doesn't comply with this will be deleted permanently according to Mark Zuckenburg, the founder. And is it true that we must turn off our cellphones at 10:30 pm to 3:30 am here in the Philippines? Someone says, that time it will be radioactive because of cosmic rays and nucli atomic. Please help me!"
