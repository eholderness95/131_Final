Right now there's one of these suggestions every few posts on my timeline and all they do is clutter it up and make it hard to read, ESPECIALLY with all the promoted and sponsored garbage that's suddenly appearing.  My family and friends altogether don't post as much stuff on my timeline as Facebook does."
