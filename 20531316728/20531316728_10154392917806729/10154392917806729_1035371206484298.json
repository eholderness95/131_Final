        "message": "I can't believe this, but Facebook just disabled my personal account again.  They disabled my Betty Daisy Pine  account/profile a few days ago, I resubmitted my ID from over a year ago when they did this to me. This time they restored it in a few days time instead of the 14 days it took them the very first time and....they JUST disabled it AGAIN! For the 3rd time...and I'm not doing anything! I'm a senior lady, with lots of interests, many of them reflected in my Betty Daisy Pine profile. My son is getting married on Sunday! They are in NY and I'm in CA. and I can't be there. The best way for us to connect is thru Facebook, with my real, my personal, profile. Please return my profile to me!"

I have my Betty Daisy Pine page, and it seems to me you are allowed to post and share almost anything or at least more varied things on your page vs our profiles. Can I share sales, auctions, rescues, hobbies, interests on my profile? Do we even really know what Facebook wants?"
