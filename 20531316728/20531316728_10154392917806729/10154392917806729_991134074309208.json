        "message": "Hi there, I'm managing a company page, and need to tag a person in a post, however, the tag won't stick. I find him in the drop down and select him, but when I save, I don't see anything. I've had him change his settings, so that he accepts all tags, but it still isn't working. I am at a complete loss, can you help?"
