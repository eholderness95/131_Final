Adding a new account as the legacy contact would require logging-in to the memorialized account, which is against our policy. If you still have access to your original profile, you can continue to manage the account from there.  To learn more about what legacy contacts can and can't do, please visit our Help Center: http://on.fb.me/1PXQepB. Thanks. -Azaria"
