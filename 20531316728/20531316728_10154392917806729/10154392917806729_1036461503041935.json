        "message": "I've been having problems in my group since last night with the pictures being bumped to the top of the group page when people comment on them. Normally when someone comments on a picture in an album, it bumps to the top of my group page. Since last night this is not happening - this is a huge issue, because I am going to have to go through every picture in every album to see if anyone has made comments. Can you please take a look at this and please tell me it is a temporary glitch and you can fix it!!\nWall pictures are bumping, if I comment on an album the entire album bumps, but individual pictures in the albums do not bump at all."
