Try it by clicking on the drop-down next to \"share\" and then customizing the target of the post. You can be as broad as a country and all languages or as targeted as specific language speakers in a city of your choice. Only those that meet the target will see it in their News Feed. Tell us how you use targeted posts in the comments."
