        "message": "Dear Facebook Founder,\n\nFirst, I want to thank you for have the genius to create a social networking space for people to connect, keep in touch, and even find love. In fact, my page, Beyond Black & White - The Rebirth has been unfairly targeted by people who oppose our message of empowerment of black women, and provide support for those of them who are in interracial relationships. Our first page, which consisted of 37,000 fans, was shut down by a concerted and organized effort to flag ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING, INDISCRIMINATELY, in order to silence our message and destroy our morale. Make no mistake, this is an act of social media terror. We are being falsely accused of hate speech, and bashing black men, which is patently FALSE. Me and my community are asking for your admins to do a better job at protecting pages that are vulnerable to bigotry, bullying and abuse, such as ours. \n\nRespectfully,\n\nChristelyn Russell-Karazin"
