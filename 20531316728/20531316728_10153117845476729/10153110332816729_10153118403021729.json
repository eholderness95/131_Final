        "message": "HELP!! I was listing things for sale on Facebook yardsale sites and I am now blocked from responding to anything on Facebook. My granddaughter says that Facebook thinks I was spamming. I was only listing my stuff for sale and responding to questions. The yardsale sites allow you to 'bump' and item up in the page by typing bump in the comment box, so I don't know if the typing of bump and responding to questions is the problem, but I really did not intentionally do something wrong. Please help me get my account unblocked and tell me what I did wrong, Thanks so much"
