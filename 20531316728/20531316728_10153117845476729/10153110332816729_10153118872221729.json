        "message": "FB  is a great social site and also source of good news and is very educational. It can be a very good place to visit everyday,if we just scroll past the negative remarks posted by people with broken hearts and evil inspired words and forgive them at the same time.I do believe GOD inspired all good things,but we know evil uses all things he meant to be used for good also. So invite all your family and friends and share your photos..link family...share good thoughts..greet each other with a hug and kiss (virtual reality) Teach love and peace. <3  For those who do not like a certain post...just remember others do,so remember the song>>. Walk on by,wait at the corner. (Do the same so to speak) We are to grow with the wheat  and tares until God comes and gathers the good and destroys the bad, That's his job,so we just forgive,move on and be grateful for this wonderful social page and stop a spell or scroll on by. <3"
