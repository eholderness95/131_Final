We know it will take some time to adjust to using a second app, and we\u2019ve tried to make it as convenient as possible: once you install Messenger, you\u2019ll still see message  notifications in the Facebook app, in the same place where you\u2019re used to seeing them. Tapping the notification will take you into the Messenger app, and you can easily switch back and forth. -Chantal"
