NO ITS NOT my computer, I have seen in many forums on here where everyone is having the same issue....please quit \"helping our time on here\" quit trying to make it better, the more you all do, the worse things are getting. YES I would love to meet the faces behind facebook to see if they really are fixing the problems or creating them to frustrate us........"
