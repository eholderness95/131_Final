        "message": "My Facebook page (not personal profile) was hijacked by spammers over the summer and this problem STILL hasn't been resolved. Pictures of myself, my husband, and my kids are on that page, along with my work email which is being flooded with harassing and threatening messages now. I would like to either be able to regain control of the page that I maintained for my business for years, or I would like it removed so that I am no longer associated with the spam that is being posted every couple minutes and people no longer have access to my email address. This has gone on too long Facebook."
