There needs to be a security measure in place to where the FB user has to approve being added to a group. The issue is, a lot of these groups are public. NOT WHAT I WANT even if they were closed. Please change your settings. It would be terrible if we were added to a group about disgust of our President while my Wife serves this country & I am a Veteran. Not saying this would happen, but we do have folks on our page that could think up these things. So PLEASE change these settings IMMEDIATELY!!!\n\nIn addition, We love our President.\u2764\ufe0f"
