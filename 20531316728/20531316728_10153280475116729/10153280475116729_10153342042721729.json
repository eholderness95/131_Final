        "message": "Were changes to our posts made as a result of some peoples dislike of the year in review? I didn't elect to create one because we suffered a loss in early December. Several condolences were posted to my page and my husbands and all have disappeared. Any reference to the loss of our son has been removed from our pages. I didn't want the year in review but I didn't elect to have any hurtful memories deleted either. I liked to look back at the condolences for comfort from time to time and they are all gone. Every other silly post I have made since creating my page is still possible to find but the ones starting on 12/2/14 are gone. Please put them back."
