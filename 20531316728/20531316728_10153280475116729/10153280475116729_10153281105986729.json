So my customizing doesn't open on others newsfeed?  Everyone else said they see only 10,   If I deleted and started over, what should I do to have my custom photos show up for everyone?"

            "message": "Hey Cari. Thanks for your question! People who see your Year in Review will only be able to see photos that they're in the audience to see. For example, if you include a friend\u2019s photo that you were tagged in, then share your Year in Review with a public setting, only people who could see your friend\u2019s photo will be able to see it in your Year in Review. Hope that helps! -Natalie"

I didn't notice until I read your comment here.  I deleted that Review and a new one popped up.  I only added a few.  Thank you for your time."
