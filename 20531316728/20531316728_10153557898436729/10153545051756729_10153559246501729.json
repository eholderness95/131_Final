        "message": "I'm from York, PA. I moved to SC when I was 13, then to NC at 14, and at 22 I moved to the opposite side of PA than where I'm from. I acquired a best friend in NC who moved back home to Baltimore, and because of Facebook, I'm able to keep all those people from all those places in my life, easily. Thanks Facebook!"
