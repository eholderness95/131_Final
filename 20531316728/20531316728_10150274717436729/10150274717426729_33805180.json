It is intrusive and rude!!!! Come on, FB, you can do better than this! It is very DISCONNECTING! I think it is wrong to share my photos with people I don't know because some intermediate friend liked it. And I don't want to see my sister's likes of political and social movements I disagree with. Have some class, Facebook. This should be a no-brainer and an easy coding!"
