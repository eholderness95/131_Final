Just because I give the key to my house to a neighbor so they can water my plants ( a feature I want) doesn't mean they can't use that same persmission to rifle through the rest of my belongings with that exact \"permission\" (a total invasion of my privacy). I could never call the police on my neighbor if I found out what they were doing because I gave them persmission to enter my home. Your regular app had too many permissions \"required\" and your messenger app asked for more and now I have removed your regular app from my phone."

Because I see Walmart and Liberty Mutual listed in my likes and I while I have purchased a couple of things from Walmart over the years, have nothing to do with Liberty Mutual which means they must have posted a picture or a meme that I liked and now I forevermore like Liberty Mutual and this information is sent to all my friends."
