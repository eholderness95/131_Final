        "message": "Could someone...anyone??...at FaceBook grow some and reply to some of these 'NEGATIVE' comments? Not just the .01% that say how much they love you? Most of us have been FB users and lovers for MANY years...why fix something that isn't broken? Why make it OBLIGATORY for ALL FaceBook users to download this new app? I only ever used it to communicate with one friend from Mexico in a group chat, and she has since switched to WhatsApp, so we have our group chat on that app. I DONT need Messenger, or want it on my phone!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FaceBook answer this post or the one of the other 99.9% of the other posts AGAINST the necessity of having to download an app that worked fine where it was in the first place!"
