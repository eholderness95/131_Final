There is no reason to have an extra app just for messaging if the original facebook app could do that anyway. It's just a waste of space and is completely irritating. Pretty much the only thing I used my fb app for was messaging. Guess I'm just gonna delete it now. Thanks Facebook."

(It's actually very tiny, it takes up hardly any space at all) The messaging feature is much better in the app too.

They aren't asking for a kidney, life goes on with a separate messenging app."
