Can't turn off notifications, can't assign a password from iPhone to sign into it ... anyone that gets my iPhone could read all my messages ... after all \"private messages\" are supposed to be just that and NOT displayed on my phone everytime I get one!  Can't delete conversations and certainly don't want them archived!  Come on Facebook, this sucks!"
