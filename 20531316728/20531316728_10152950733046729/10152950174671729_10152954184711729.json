        "message": "Facebook, can you please stop making silly updates. I don't want nor do I need Facebook Messenger. Please bring back our messaging on this app. I barely have space on my phone as it is, don't have room for other stuff. The messenger is useless. Also this top stories thing is getting ridiculous. It seems as if you do not put the people at heart when designing your app. You must have a team of people who only work for what they think is a good idea, and say screw what anyone else thinks."
