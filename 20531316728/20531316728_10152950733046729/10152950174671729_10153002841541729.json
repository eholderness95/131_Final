        "message": "Dear Facebook, I appreciate your message to me today clearing up what you call misunderstandings about your Messenger App. However your basic argument for the reason people would want it has not changed. You think I want to respond 20% faster on the messenger app when I really don't care about that. I like enjoying ALL of my Facebook experiences in ONE App. If I wanted a different App, I would use Snap Chat or Skype or better yet I'd just send my Friends a Text or actually Call them. I like your message feature because it allows me to send messages to people of things I'm thinking about while I'm on Facebook. If I wanted to see those things, press my home button to close the Facebook App, open a new App to type my message to my friend, tell them about something discrete I saw on Facebook, just to have them open your messaging app, read my message, hit their home button to close the messaging app, go into their Facebook App to see what I'm talking about, hit their home button to close the Facebook App, open the messenger app, and respond to me... I probably wouldn't bother or I'd just send them a text. The beauty of being able to Facebook Message in the Facebook App was everything was in ONE APP! Quit pretending you are Microsoft by trying to force us to do things we don't want to do and actually think of what you are doing and how many people want to do something. I don't have your Messenger App because it's RIDICULOUS, not because of all the BS being spread about it!"
