It's like a monopoly run by a dictator, forcing you to do something and not care about it because well, they can. I'm deleted my Facebook app and using only the mobile web based site. I refuse to download the app. Here's a brilliant idea, if I want to message someone but don't want to do it through the Facebook app, I'll just text them!!!! Imagine that!!!"
