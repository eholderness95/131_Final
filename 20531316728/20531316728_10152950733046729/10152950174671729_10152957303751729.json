        "message": "Hey, Facebook. I am SUPER irritated in your Facebook Messenger. Almost to the point where I am considering getting rid of FB all together. I do not want to, but after the privacy concerns and now I am REQUIRED to download the messenger app separately if I want to use it at all on my mobile device. This is ridiculous, and I am extremely irritated, frustrated, and just done with having to constantly tell you NO I DONT WANT THIS FEATURE."
