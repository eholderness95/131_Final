        "message": "How about you share some advertising money with us for forcing us to give up privacy to message our friends and download a second app to fix something that wasn't broken.  Facebook is going down the same road Myspace did.  What happened to the simplistic layouts, easy to keep up with friends and family.  And now your re-organizing our news feed, forcing additional apps down our throats, and giving up more and more privacy.  \n\nAny response besides sending us to another feedback page where we won't hear anything back?  How about a real answer?"
