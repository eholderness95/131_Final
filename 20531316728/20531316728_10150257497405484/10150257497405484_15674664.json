What good is it to you if nobody you know wants to use it?\n\nI think people are skeptical of facebook and everything they have their hands in.  Too many horror stories involving Facebook.  \n\nOther people have a valid complaint as well, when the Facebook website isnt working right half of the time, why the heck are they moving on to other things without perfecting what they dumped on everyone already?  Every time Facebook claims to make an improvement, they make things worse.  \n\nThey need to stop laying out all these turds.  Its gotta be about time to wipe, right!?"
