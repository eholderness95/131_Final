        "message": "Well uv pointed a good point here. BUT this can cause troubles. I mean for e.g you add someone u don't know and then that person stalked you. You don't know maybe on day they'll rape you then it goes on some kind of tv show like dr phill and they'll sew you. This is my opinion, I don't think it's a good idea. Also like some people add others they know on fb but they might not like them and that person starts following them.  Not because you're friends in fb means that you ARE friends. I mean I have to admit, I add ppl on fb I know, all types. Like or not. It's just fb. "
