        "message": "why does it have to be the us that gets these features first what is the problem in releasing it worldwide, I'm in australia and i cant use this until its available here, if you want to actually add in all the places in the check in list i know that takes time but why not just add a places option to just pin point and share your current location on the google map no matter where it is for now until you get the names of the places ready, Like I can be sitting at my friends place and share the exact location coordinates of that place and title it as my friends place, and as people try to pin point the same location facebook can remember the name I gave to that place in the first place and suggest it to someone else if they are in that area. well at least this could be available immediately all over the world it should'nt be hard to share a google map co-ordinate."
