        "message": "For those of you who don't have a video showing up but viewed it in Firefox:\n\n? edited 36 mins ago\n\nI was able to download my video on Firefox.\nFirst you need to not close your browser or clear your cache since you watched the video.\n1. In Firefox, type \"about:cache\" into the URL field and enter\n2. Click the \"List Cache Entries\" button under the \"Disk Cache Device\" field.\n3. Do a search for mp4. I found a few and the one closest to the time I viewed my video ended up being the correct link. It looks like https://lookbackvideo4-a.akamaihd.net/hvideo-ak-frc3.mp4? ... I opened the link in a new tab, clicked the link, and the video played in its own tab. I went to File, Save As, and saved the .mp4 file\n\nFor chrome:\n\nDani edited 18 mins ago\nIf you used Chrome when you watched your video prior to deleting, just do these:\n\nType about:cache on your chrome search bar (provided that you don't clear history/cache after you close your browser)\nYou will see a list of links on your window, just click Ctrl F or \u2318 F to and search \"lookback\" in the Find searchbar\nLook for the link that will have something like https://lookbackvideo7-a.akamaihd.net/hvideo and so on. Click that link.\nAfter you clicked the link, you will see on your window a bunch of text with white background. Ignore that. LOOK AT YOUR URL BAR. You should be able to see something like chrome://view-http-cache/https://lookbackvideo7-a.akamaihd.net/hvideo-ak-prn etc etc. In the long string of url, DELETE THIS PART: chrome://view-http-cache/ then press enter.\nYou should be able to see your video again. Right click and choose \"Save Video As\" and just reupload on your Facebook timeline, Youtube, or anywhere."
