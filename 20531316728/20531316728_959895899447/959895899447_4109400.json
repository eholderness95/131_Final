        "message": "Dear facebook,\n    Hi my names Matthew i know you have a million emails a day. But im asking to please help if you can. My friend Xavier Alvarez passed away tragically in a motorcycle accident july 2012 at the age of 27. He was less than a block from being home. :( he was the only son of 4 siblings and He loved his parents but because they are a more traditional hispanic family they often didnt see eye to eye.. His parents dont have a facebook and cant even view his pictures. Im the only friend that visits his parents till this day and his urn at his parents house. Im asking if you can release his \"A Look Back\" video just so they can see that Xavier was an amazing person who was selfless and lived his family unconditionally. Im not sure if this is how to go about this, but i got to start somewhere. His parents deserve to see his video. They loved him and he loved them they both knew it, but they wishes they would have told him more! So please HELP with A Look Back if you can...\nThank you and any help would be appreciated. \n\nMatthew Nunez"
