        "message": "I agree..... saw my video.... at first didn't see where to share it... so, I tried several times; then after I noticed it in front of my face practically.... my photo's were mainly of others (some I don't know, because they are in my history... I take pictures from others birthday parties and such) so I tried to \"delete/only me viewing\" those albums out; and it's like you locked my video and all I get now is a page with pictures (that I can't even share!).  Would love to \"look back\" too at my own.... thought I could restart my computer to reboot  and my albums would have been adjusted for the video with the \"only me\" albums - but nope!   Very Disappointed! ! !   Would love for you to fix this glinch in the \"look back\" video."
