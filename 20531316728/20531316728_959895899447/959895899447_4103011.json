        "message": "i am so surprised at all the negativity regarding the lookback videos! i think it was a nice thing to do because technically the facebook staff didn't have to do anything for us..............it was their celebration! How can so many people be so ungrateful & critical over a nice gesture? I personally think that it was a cool idea & I especially think it is awesome what they did for the Berlin family!! The staff will now be very busy trying to help all those who have had loved ones pass away and I think the criticism towards them should stop!! I thank you, Facebook & keep up the good work!"
