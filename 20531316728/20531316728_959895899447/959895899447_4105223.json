        "message": "I WANT TO SAY A BIG THANKS! I started FB while my daughter was in the hospital. She was very, very, very sick and it was a way to give updates on her progress. Sadly, she passed away on 6/27/09 from MRSA and complications of H1N1, then it was followed by another 9 months of one thing after another, including cancer. It captured those moments over the last almost 5 years beautifully.  I would love to thank u personally. That is my angel in my profile pic."
