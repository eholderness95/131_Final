        "message": "What up Facebook! Love everything about you, except for one tiny minor thing.....\nWhat is up with the video play on the app for the past month??? Everytime a video starts to play, it's freezes, lags then I have to hard close the app. I know a number of people who are experiencing the same problem!! Granted all own apple products but I was wondering if this was something that is being worked on!! \nMany thanks in advance. \nMelissa"
