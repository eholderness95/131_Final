Believe me, however, we can put our confidence in God, HE never, never let's us down. I pray to GOD for Facebook and everyone that is on FB\nso that ALL will go well and GOD'S presence will bring happiness and contentment to US ALL.\nBelieve me God is everything and in everything. We can't leave Him out.\nBryan, Have yourself a wonderful weekend!"
