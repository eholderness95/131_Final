        "message": "I want to express my gratitude for Facebook because I have been reunited with friends all over the united states that I haven't seen in 20 or 30 years!  Also I crochet and knit and quilt and the different groups I belong to and getting to see other people's crafts is inspiring!  One website is in South Africa!  Also I join others to provide prayers for comfort and  strength to all our Facebook friends.   I'm a great grandma and love love love Facebook!"
