        "message": "When I look at my \"Year in Review\"  as it was auto-generated,  it says \"tap customize to personalize yours\"; yet there is NO customize button to click to create and personalize mine! I don't like it the way it was auto-generated, and want to make it more personalized. Can you please correct this issue so I can truly make my year in review more to my liking? All my friends have truly customized theirs and they are amazing! I'd like to be able to do the same for mine. Thank you so much for your consideration of this issue. :)"
