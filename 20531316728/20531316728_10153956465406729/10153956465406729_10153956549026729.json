        "message": "This is great, but people at home are starving also, let's fix things here as a priority. I don't even know what or who or where Myanmar is? Can't China help them? Isn't China drilling, operating, and exporting most of their natural gas? And Russia has their hands on it as well, the corrupt government is allowing foreign lands to exploit the resources of Burma's people and government officials are aquiring massive wealth. And you want us to feed them? Hey Facebook, pick an American cause or at least tell us who's letting down, ravaging, and pilfering the people and places you want american dollars to go to."
