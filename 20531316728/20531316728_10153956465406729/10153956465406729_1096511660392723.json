Well I am doing this first of all with gods blessing , hope and good faith.I have seen my family worried for too long!!!i know there is someone out there kind enough to help.We are in desperate need of donations for our family owned business that has been struggling to get back off the ground since the company service truck was stolen with all our service equipment! );. It has been a long time coming now to just let money stand in our way from getting back on the road .We have the most highly skilled group of mechanics ready and willing to work but due to financial situations we are forced to stop process and try to raise enough money to keep our jobs ourselves and get a good reliable business going.We are also taking material donations such as air tools hand tools and any other repair tools you may have.We are going to use these donations to get a good service truck 97 chevy clunker will do,lol ,a 12' ladder and sum of the heavy equipment tools we will need.We have most hand tools and various other things needed to start off .We are usually the ones to help others in need so this time we hope you will help us . Anything is a true Blessing. Thank you to Gofundme and Thanks to everybody who helps even by sharing .\nHey, Good friends ,Please share, Please help them get to work!!Anything is a true Blessing folks.\n\nThis is the fundraising campaign for First Trailer Repair Fundraiser: gofundme.com/qgxsypmk"
