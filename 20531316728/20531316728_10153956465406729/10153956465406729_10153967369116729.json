        "message": "Dear Facebook Team,\n\nOn the 2nd of Aug 2015, I've wrote an opened letter along with some pictures to Mr. Mark Zuckerberg, hoping that he and Facebook team will find some kindness to help us in promoting Myanmar flood relief. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/myochitmyanmar/media_set?set=a.1142821912401333.1073741881.100000206043143\n\nToday I've seen that you have not only established the donation center for Myanmar Flood Relief, you are even matching it up to a half million USD$.\n\nMy letter may or may not have anything to do with your action but there is no exact words to express how incredibly I appreciate what you've just done for our People.\n\nI will never forget this.\n\nI just want to shout out \"THANKS\" to all of you.\n\nI also want to apologize for responding this late.\nSo I've created these logos to show our appreciation to Facebook and you will be seeing many of these on profiles of Myanmar nationals in a few days.\n\n(Cover Photo) https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1148363788513812&l=ee9f16db85\n\n(Profile Picture) https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1148363791847145&l=c3a367da9b\n\nMay god bless you all.\n\nWE LOVE YOU FACEBOOK.\n\nIvan Oo (AKA) Myo Chit Myanmar \n\n#SaveMyanmar\n#RescueMyanmar\n#HelpMyanmar\n#SupportMyanmar"
