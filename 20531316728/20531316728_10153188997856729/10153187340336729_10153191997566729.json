        "message": "I reported a page about dogfighting, which is essentially illegal everywhere in the US at both the state and federal level. I was told that the page doesn't violate community standards. If those are the standards of the community, y'all can take those \"standards\" and shove them where the sun doesn't shine. Facebook allowing such content but removing pictures and pages about BREASTFEEDING is unbelievably atrocious conduct on the behalf of Facebook."
