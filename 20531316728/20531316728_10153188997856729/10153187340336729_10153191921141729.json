And the messenger app is to noticeable. So anytime I go to message someone. I can clearly see the app opening rather then it feeling like a fluid single piece. \nAnd the lack of freedom over features is a huge turn off for me.\nAlso I don't like the notification style of the messenger app. And am kinda concerned on the stability and weight the app puts on my phone. I'm very anal about apps running in the background. \nMaybe down the road I'll conform to the switch. But atm. I either ignore messages. Or wait until I'm on my computer to answer them."
