        "message": "So 9,000 people like my business page and when I post something only 100 people see it? What is this extortion Facebook? If you sign up for a mailing list you expect to get the email.... if someone is getting spammed by my business they can just UNLIKE us. It's such a shame I'm forced to spend hundreds of dollars just so people who actually \"liked\" my page can see my posts. Will this change in the future?"
