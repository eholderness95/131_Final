        "message": "No matter what you do, some people will always complain...everyone has a CHOICE to be on Facebook...so many people complain about it, yet, still use it...guess it's not really all that bad. As for me, I love that Facebook has allowed me to connect and stay connected with friends and family since August 2005. If you're concerned about \"privacy\" then do NOT use the Internet, smart phones, tablets, or social media...but, since most of you use many of the above mentioned, I don't see why you're complaining. Thanks Facebook, there are more things I like than dislike, and I adjust to changes accordingly."
