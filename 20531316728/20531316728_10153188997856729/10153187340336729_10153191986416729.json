        "message": "So if I'm in charge how do I make it so my newsfeed stops randomly refreshing and throwing me back to the top of the page right as I'm reading the first post to actually be of interest? Or make it so posts show up when posted, not hours or days later? Or make it so when I click on a link to read the article I can hit the back button and return to the post the article was from so I can like or comment on it without having to fish back through my newsfeed AGAIN, which has reordered itself so I never do find that article again? These things are very frustrating. Please don't tell me I'm in charge when I have zero control on how my newsfeed behaves."
