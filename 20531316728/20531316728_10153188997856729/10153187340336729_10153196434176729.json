        "message": "I have a suggestion...when sad things show up in my feed, I always click \"I dont want to see this\". You need to add a \"this is too sad\" option for the reason for hiding the post (or something along those lines...it's not offensive, it's just depressing). I know I'm not the only person who does that. And it would be useful info for your algorithm so that less sad things show up in our feeds."
