The only people that care about my comment or my like is that friend or mutual friends that see that particular post or picture. And it's no one else's business what I'm commenting on or liking, again unless it's mutual friends. I don't want to know what my friend \"liked\" or commented on...and it clutters the news feed. There needs to be a privacy feature for this or better yet eliminated all together."
