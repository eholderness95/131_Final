        "message": "2 biggest peeves:\nPosts and comments come in randomly. Why can't they be shown chronologically? Especially in the evening, I get brand new posts and 1 or 2 day old posts in no order.\n2nd: I do not receive all posts from groups (and some friends). Some days I get all, other days a couple, sometimes none at all for a day or more. I know I'm not getting them all because friends in same groups talk about posts I never got and vice versa. Who is deciding for me what I see?"
