        "message": "I have a request about this application for becoming better & complete! , in first congratulations for adding Tag option, secondly it will be better and best when you add a text editing option, also download or copieng a piture, it helps those phones which aren't touch screen!\nthen why you deleted a better applying option from fb? Many time ago if i went toward my shared things from pages, without any post view option with just once clicking on, i found an all explained and complete text, but now there is no facility like that, and i never read completely those i shared, via this application! Plz renew a complete and best fb app!!! Tnx alot"
