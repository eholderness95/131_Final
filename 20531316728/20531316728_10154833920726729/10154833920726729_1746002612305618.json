        "message": "When are you going to make messenger worth anything for the iOS? It's a glorified second texting system. We don't get the chat bubbles the android does. Every update makes the app worse. The newest one? You put the active now people above my recent conversations so now that's just in the way? My conversations should be at the top since that's all I come into the app for? I might as well just delete it and use texting. Since at least that uses less of my battery power even if they're the same thing."
