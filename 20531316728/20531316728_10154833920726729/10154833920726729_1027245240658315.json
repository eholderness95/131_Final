Get off the messenger and talk to people on the phone or in person.  Not once have I loaded this and have gotten it to work from my phones. Now I have 7 phones so explain that. I am happy for all these happy people.  Out it in my browser or how about when I open Facebook from my phone it just opens like on a regular computer. How about that?"
