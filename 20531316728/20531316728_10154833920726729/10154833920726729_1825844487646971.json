        "message": "Omg I hate hate hate the new messenger. It used to be so simple, so elegant, so intuitive. Now it's trying to be all things to all people and I don't need that. \n\nI have an sms app; I have Line and GroupMe. I have Hangouts and Skype. I dont need Messenger to do any of that; I just need a simple way to pm my FB friends. \n\nWhy does it have to be so complicated?\n\nI also hate the marketplace icon in the Android app. It's too prominent. There should be a way to mute it and take it off the main menu."
