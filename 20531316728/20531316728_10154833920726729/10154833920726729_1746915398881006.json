        "message": "Sorry that this question is unrelated to the video, or if this isn't the right forum, but is there a way to hide the \"Trending\" news on desktop or mobile? I've searched everywhere in the settings. If it isn't something that can be done, is there a function to add it in the future?\n\nI like WWE but often watch it on delay and the Trending topics have spoiled four straight pay-per-view events for me. I'm really not a fan of having match results trending the morning after I can't finish a PPV event. Thanks in advance."
