        "message": "Dear FB - I am not so happy with the new \"stories\" section added to messenger. Personally I am not interested in it since I have other accounts fulfilling this duty. What bothers me is how much space it occupies, when I am only interested in my messages. Visually it is not appealing to me. In the future, will you consider to make it an option to hide/disable the stories section for people who have no interest in this? Thanks and happy New Years."
