        "message": "As for changes on Facebook. .... I would love to have a wider range of colors to chose from other then blue!!!! And let's not remove that option weeks to months later like you do with other options that you give to your customers then take it away! Speaking of. ... the balloons are great but whatever happened to the pretty colorful flowers? My point exactly! Also, a MP3 to share our favorite music with others like MySpace had would be awesome! I have put these suggestion in many times over the past few years and nothing! I will continue to expect the same results! Thanks \ud83d\ude09"
