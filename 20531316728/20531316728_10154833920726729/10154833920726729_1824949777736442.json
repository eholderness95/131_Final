Since you've changed the look of the newsfeed (front page) are you planning on updated the issues? The left side area that is titled \"Shortcuts\" I have pages in there that I no longer own or manage along with groups that I've left and you can no longer favorite a group to show up in that area. And you can't rearrange the order of the pages you manage or own."
