        "message": "While I liked the perks, I did not find Messenger to be a beneficial application. There is no option to log out, which is inconvenient because, as anyone with a smart phone knows, applications left open will eat your battery up. At first I thought this was something accidentally over looked, but after a year, it still has not changed. \nIf you're going to disable using the messenger on the websites via mobile in order to boost your downloads for the app, at least give us the option to log out when we aren't using it. I ended up having to uninstall it to save trouble."
