It was definitely a pain not to be able to access messages through the app these past two years but it was better than being FORCED to download the separate Messenger app which many people refuse to do for one reason or another. The Facebook app and mobile sites should offer the same services as the desktop version. Thank you in advance for considering the wants of your consumers."

No. While most companies are bending over backwards to integrate their products for a seamless user experience, this is a huge step away from that and frustrating for your users. The functionality should be the same no matter what platform you are logging in from. I don't even care if you \"spy\" on my messages lol, just give me access to them as well. All in all, I love Facebook and it exceeds my needs in most instances, but this particular issue is dissatisfying (and clearly I'm not the only person to feel this way).\n\nThank you in advance for your generic placating deflection of a response to my complaint."

For people who consistently message others on Facebook, messenger is great, but for those who lack space, time, or even necessity, the fact that we are limited to seeing our messages or even who sent them is extremely inconvenient and rather annoying. I like using this website, but restricting what I can see from my mobile device so you can get what, more ad money from people using 2 apps to access your site functions? Thats ridiculous."
