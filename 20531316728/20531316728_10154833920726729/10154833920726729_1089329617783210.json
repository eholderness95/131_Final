Same facebook sucks when it comes down to private profile. Heck MYSPACE has a better private profile feature. Esp when it comes to cover photos. Etc. Also I have people I've never talked to on my messenger app they aren't in my contacts.etc never message request them.etc and yet they are on my messenger. Also quit putting so many in app things."
