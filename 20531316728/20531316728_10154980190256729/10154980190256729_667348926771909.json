I had that account for 5 years, and all of the photos i took over those 5 years were on that account, i would really like to be able to log into the account so that i could put all of my photos on a flashdrive, and then delete the account. I have no photos from 12-16 anywhere else,  they were all stored on that account. Please allow me to receive photos from my childhood that i may never get back."
