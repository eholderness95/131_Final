One was literature, in which I'm really interested, where i had several publishing houses, magazines of literature etc. They could be found a couple of steps below 'Most recent'.\nNow i cannot find my feeds. what have you done with them?\nI really would like to have them back as i very much enjoy reading them. \nNow, where can I find them again?\nYours, \nJohan"

It's too much and you loose far more than you can possibly win. That only means that I'm using Facebook a whole lot less. \nWhy remove them?"

With 3 or 4 feeds it is much easier to keep track of what's happening within one area of interest. Now, everything gets mixed up. Simply to many updates and posts.
