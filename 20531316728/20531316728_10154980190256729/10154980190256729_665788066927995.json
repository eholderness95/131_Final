        "message": "Speaking about news feed. The phone-app has been acting crazy for a long time. When i want to share, comment or post something, be it in groups, on pages, my own profile, friend's profiles, i just get sent back to the news feed. It's really annoying and has been going on for months. I just got a new phone, had the same problem with my old one. It feels like i'm not allowed to be other places than the newsfeed. Just tried to post in a group four times in a row and just got sent back to the news feed every time ! It's really really annoying. Fix the phone-app, please ! I'm not the only one having this problem either."
