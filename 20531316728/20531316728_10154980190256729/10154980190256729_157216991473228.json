        "message": "Wtf, Facebook? I glanced at my news feed before bed last night and saw that my kid uploaded a bunch of Easter pics. There were also a couple memes I considered reposting and an article I wanted to read. But it was late, and I was tired, so I decided to check back in the am.\n\nThis morning, none of these posts exist on my news feed. I scrolled all the way to where it says Add more friends to see more stories\u2026 What??!!?? I don't want more friends. I clearly don't have the time or inclination to keep up with the ones I've got. Especially if their posts disappear after I scroll past them once.\n\nThis has been a major part of why I'm no longer active here. I only check in sporadically, and sometimes with only a few minutes to spare. There have been a ton of posts I've missed because I clicked an article or put down my phone, only for FB to refresh and erase the post from my feed. This makes \u201ccatching up\u201d nearly impossible\n\nTLDR: Did Facebook become Snapchat? Cuz I am not on board for that \ud83d\ude20"
