        "message": "Hey there,\n\nBeen trying to edit/change the name of my company`s page for a while now. Was a joint venture with someone, hence the company name consisted -in part- of our names, however since said someone left the venture, his name as part of the page is now misleading, and distracting to the customers. As I`ve tried to change the name multiple times without any success, and even wrote numerous letters as a response to the rejection of my requests, explaining the issue with the name of the page -goes without saying, I`ve never received a reply-, I would like to get assistance with my issue asap.\n\nThanks in advance."

I would  really like to get this issue sorted asap, as the  name is misleading, and the root of many misunderstandings. Thanks in advance.\n\nP.S.: I know realize that I can not attach a picture here, but the point is, my query got the following reply: \"We are not actyvely monitoring messages sent to this page.
