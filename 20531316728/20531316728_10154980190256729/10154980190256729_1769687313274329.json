        "message": "When I try to comment on my own page or actually any page other than this particular one my posts are garbled. For instance, if I type the words thanks, it instead looks more like hankst and then will repeat ithe garbled sentance even if I go back over and correct it before hitting enter. This only happens on my computer, not when I type on my cell phone or tablet. I have run virus scan but don't come up with any problems so not sure how to fix this issue."
