        "message": "Hi Facebook, I would like to suggest adding some sort of badge on someone's profile telling us how active a person is. I would really suggest that and I think it would look cool.\nNow, regarding my problem. I had an account about 3 years ago. I forgot its password and Its been stagnant ever since. My friends from my previous school think I'm dead because I haven't logged on in 3 years. I would like to either remove that account or get back the password. Thank you in advance and I wish you a great day."
