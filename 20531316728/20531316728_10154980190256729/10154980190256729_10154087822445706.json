        "message": "Facebook, can you add a button for bookmarking within a page? For instance, I want to read all the posts on your Facebook page but in case I get interrupted and leave the page, it automatically scrolls back to the top post. \nIt's frustrating and time consuming to scroll all the way down to where I left off. Hope there's a way to make it easier to access old posts without manually scrolling. Thank you."
