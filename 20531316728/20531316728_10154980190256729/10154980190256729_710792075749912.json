Please I know I can block, unfollow, unfriend or message someone about the issue, the first three don't solve the issue of the picture being there. I've sent messages with no reply, comment on the picture was taken down(my bfs comment not the picture) please let me know how this can be fixed. I don't like my kids photos shared around especially without my permission\ud83d\ude1e thank you."
