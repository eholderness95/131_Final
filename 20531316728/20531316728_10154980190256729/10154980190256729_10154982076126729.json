        "message": "Facebook is absolutely the greatest thing for me! I can keep up with friends and family that are local as well as the ones around the world. I see pictures of what they do and where they vacation and it gives me joy. If anyone is having a bad time you know about it and can offer support! Birthday greetings are fun to give and receive. I also love the sites that post meaningful thoughts or beautiful pictures of nature, or far away places! What is not to like? FB has brought us closer and as I get older I will be even more grateful for this way of communicating!!!! Thank you FB people and Mark! Happy 10th Birthday!!!"
