        "message": "Also, the iOS app continuously repeats updates each time I refresh. It is very annoying to refresh and have it load new updates only to find out they are copies of the last 3 updates I just read. It will do this 3 or four times. Its ok to say I don't have new updates, I can handle it. Its like looking forward to a new episode of a TV program only to find out I'd seen it already, twice."

No matter where i am, what i post, comment, etc- or try to !- i just get kicked back to the bloody news feed ! I just tried to post on a page several times and i just got sent to the news feed when i hit \"Post\". Just got a new phone and had the same problem with my old. And i can see others have the same or similar problems. So please do something about that phone-app !! Submitting a report dosen't help, i tried and no response from you or fixing the problem ! Looks like you just think it's funny. Guess you have no problems with the phone-app yourself... \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21"
