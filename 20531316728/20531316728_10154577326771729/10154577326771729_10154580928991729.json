Pages will still have all of the same capabilities as before; people will now have to login with their own individual account and then select the Page they manage when posting, commenting on or liking other Pages.\nTo see a feed of all of the Pages your Page likes, navigate to your Page and select \u201cView Pages Feed\u201d under your Page's profile picture. Hope this does the trick! -Jordan"
