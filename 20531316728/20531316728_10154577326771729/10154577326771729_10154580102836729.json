        "message": "So errr it's been way more than sixty days since I was locked out of my account and had to change my username, which to me seemed very strange because the name I had is the one I use in my social and professional life so it it is the one people recognize for over 25 years as my name for all intents and purposes, and it was neither obscene or evasive or even strange. Also it was never a stealth account and I have never intentionally violated the rules of conduct. Now I want to change it on my own accord but the settings page still says I've changed it too often. In the ten years I've been a client here I have only changed it once! So I don't know what's going on here and like an explanation please, preferably through PM. I have reported this issue before but was met with an almost kafkaesque lack of service and response which to be honest hasnt been a very positive userexperience. Step up facebook, you're supposed to be better than that."
