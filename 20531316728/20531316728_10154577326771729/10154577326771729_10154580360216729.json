Whether I have a strong wifi connection or data connection, nothing wants to load properly. I can rarely watch videos. I have to close down the app several times just to load something. You think yal updating Facebook everyday that it'd run perfectly. Nope. Yal have changed it so much that it's basically useless. Highly disappointed"
