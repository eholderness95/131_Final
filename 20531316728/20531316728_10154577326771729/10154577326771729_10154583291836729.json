        "message": "this is a second request.....Patricia Vaughn ..Please tell me why you keep taking more and more of my viewing screen? Your right hand column is over 6 inches wide and the left hand column is 4 inches wide. It keeps getting worse and as I have reported in the past I am unable to play some of the games I want and now some of my news feed is cut in half. Please knock it off...there is nothing important in the right hand column and my preference list on the left should only be half as wide."
