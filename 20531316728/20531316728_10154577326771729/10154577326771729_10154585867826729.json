        "message": "I love facebook because it enables me to keep up with my family who are spread out all over the country. However, today I got what I think must be a scam. Is Jeffrey Henry really a facebook employee like he says? In your prize promotion department? He's saying that if I send $1500 that UPS will deliver 150,000 to me. Could you get in touch with me ASAP wether this is legitimate."
