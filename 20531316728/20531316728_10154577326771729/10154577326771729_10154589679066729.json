        "message": "Performance optimizations plannned on the chat? or is it the Chrome browser that is mostly to blame? My point is that right now i'm on a laptop with a dualcore 2.1ghz cpu. and my typing gets interrupted when typing in the facebook chat by the chat causing 100% cpu spikes. Back in the day when i owned a 233mhz single core cpu in my first PC. Chat programs ran just fine with no interruptions. browsing was fast, the OS was fast, everything exept gaming, high res video and producing music ofc. But anything happening in the browser just worked. So explain to me why a cpu lightyears ahead can't handle typing in a simple chat?"
