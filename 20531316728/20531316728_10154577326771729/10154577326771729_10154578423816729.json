        "message": "Can we have a say/choice whenever a fb Live post comes on? I think I've unlike people because as I surf fb suddenly I'm watching/participating (?!??!) in some activity I never agreed to be a part of. I dislike this feature. I appreciate that you've explained tidbits of a fb Live post but it should be an option not an inclusion. Thanks & keep us updated on fb Live/mentions."
