        "message": "FACEBOOK- I've been emailing, trying to get help with my verified business page. A concern and question not answered online in the FAQs or help page.Every email I receive back is generic and says to look cuz they can't help. But if ppl work for the company, including creators, someone can help!!!! \n\nI'm trying to block a \"troll\" to my business page. They haven't liked or commented but watch the content and even claim ownership on their own personal page of my business in their work section. I'm in a small community and don't appreciate this. They won't take it down. \nHow can you help me block them and remove it from their page? I have already verified my business and can provide more paperwork to show they never owned it!\n\nCan someone please help me?"
