        "message": "Help Facebook!!! I've lost the FB group All Things Outer Space. We cannot find it anywhere. We had almost 2,400 members last night and now the group is gone. I not any of my admins received any notices on this. Please PM me and let me know what's going on. When I try to report this issue it says \"thanks for your feedback\". I'm not filing feedback I'm filing a report. \n\nThe group URL is https://www.facebook.com/groups/AllThingsOuterSpace/. \n\nPlease help. It took us just over two years to grow this fantastic and respected group. \n\nThank you\n\nGene Beard\nGene@genebeard.com"
