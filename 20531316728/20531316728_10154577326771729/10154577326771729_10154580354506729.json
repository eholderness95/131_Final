        "message": "Seriously Facebook:\n\nYour report\n\nToday\n\nYou anonymously reported Huebner Gregory William for pretending to be someone they're not..\n\nThanks for your feedback \n\nToday\n\nThank you for taking the time to report something that you feel may violate our Community Standards. Reports like yours are an important part of making Facebook a safe and welcoming environment. We reviewed the profile you reported for pretending to be someone they're not and found it doesn't violate our Community Standards. \n\nPlease let us know if you see anything else that concerns you. If you want us to look at something specific on a profile, be sure to report the content (ex: photo), not the entire profile. We want to keep Facebook safe and welcoming for everyone. \n\nMy response: \n\nDon't know how you reviewed my complaint, but this person is using the pictures of John Atkins, former Delaware State Representative who lives in Millsboro, Delaware. The pictures Huebner Gregory William has posted are not of him. Check Mr. Atkins' FB page and his campaign page, Friends of John Atkins. Huebner Gregory William is committing fraud and you are enabling him to continue to do so."
