Something caught my attention...I heard about a young millionaire who was diagnosed with leukemia. I hope it is not one of you. My prayers blessed both of you. I hope you believe in God although you have everything you want. By the way, thank you for what you have done!!! I am now in touch with mylost friends and some relatives."
