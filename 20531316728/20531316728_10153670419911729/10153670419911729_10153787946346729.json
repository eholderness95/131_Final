The thing is that I do not need to see in my News Feed that \"person A\" posted 'happy birthday' on the wall of my friend. Because Person A and I are not Facebook friends. #Youreallyneedbetterprivacysettings I do not mean this in a rude way, but this is my opinion about it. And I know you have a lot of work on FB. With kind regards."
