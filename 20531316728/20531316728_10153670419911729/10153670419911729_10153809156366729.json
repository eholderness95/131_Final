        "message": "How do you stop being hacked? It has to be more than a password issue. I have had multiple messages to me from people I don't know and messages sent out to people I don't know, including this page. I've heard I had to get software to stop it completely, but don't know if that means buying it or just downloading it online. Please help if possible, thank you! This has happened even when we didn't have internet on at our house so that is very strange. Thanks for any help if possible."
