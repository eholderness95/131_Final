Because of this there's a limit to how many times you can change your birthday. If you've recently changed it, you may have to wait a few days before you can edit it again. Check out the link below for more information on how you can change your birthdate and the settings of who can see it. https://www.facebook.com/help/563229410363824 -Elisha"
