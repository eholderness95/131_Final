I created this page I'm on now just  to see my news & stuff, but I haven't added any friends or family bc I'm waiting to have the old account re-enabled(?) bc it's disabled.\n\nI keep getting a message about Facebook checking my documentation & getting back to me if they need further info, but I uploaded my ID's almost 2 months ago.  \n\nI'm on this thread bc this is the first place I've ever seen anyone speaking on behalf of Facebook.  Is there any way I can see the status of my account?"
