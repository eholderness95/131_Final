        "message": "Either there is someone working at Facebook who has a personal vendetta against me or Facebook officials are being partial and discriminatory against me. I request friendship with people that I know and who know me, even though there may be some who know me and who are acting hateful towards me, and Facebook has elected to block me from sending friendship request, and messages  (several times and repeatedly). I THINK FACEBOOK IS ACTING PARTIAL AND HATEFUL TOWARDS ME AND NEEDS TO CHECK IT'S EMPLOYEES AS TO THEIR POSSIBLE PERSONAL VENDETTA ATTITUDES AND RESTUDY AND EVAULATE THEIR METHODS OF CENSURE."
