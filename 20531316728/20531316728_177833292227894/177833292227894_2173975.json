Each of these pages had over 300,000 fans,\nwere the most active groups in Egypt, and were the only two outlets for\nEgyptian users to discuss issues of interest to them in a country with\none of the worst human rights records. \n\nI demand Facebook\nadministration bring back both pages and respect the wishes of myself\nand the over half a million of my fellow Egyptians, and bring back both\npages immediately. It would be very difficult for me to accept such\ncollaboration with the censorship policies with the Egyptian regime,\nand it will be very difficult for me to reward Facebook with continuing\nto use it. I will definitely be very responsive to calls of boycotting\nFacebook if the pages were not brought back, as I will not have good\nreasons to use Facebook anymore. \n\nPlease respond to my demand as soon as possible. \n\nSincerely,\n\u064d\u064d\nShady Mohammed"
