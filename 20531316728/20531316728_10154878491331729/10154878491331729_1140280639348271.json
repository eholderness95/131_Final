Atleast thats my experience everytime i report those Amen scammers who steal picks of dead and disabled people. Once even reported a scam contest page that pretended to be a legit contest page telling people they won stuff and got the same Nothing Wrong repsonse. Had a friend share a post about how the Stalone thing was a hoax and not to believe it yet to FB that was against the rules."
