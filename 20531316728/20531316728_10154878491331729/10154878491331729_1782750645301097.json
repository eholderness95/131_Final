        "message": "I was recently told I was restricted from Liking pages for a month and sharing open graph posts for a day. If someone reports you for something that should not have been reported, how is this fair? This is America. You are innocent until proven guilty, not vice versa. I was reported for sharing Olympic gymnastics posts from the NBC website. I love the Olympics. If someone reported me for sharing about something I love, that person should unfriend me. I should not be punished for THEIR behavior. Where is the logic in this policy? I want my restriction lifted, or I will go further with this complaint. This is appalling that Facebook has a policy like this. It must be changed before it affects more innocent people who are just trying to share something they love. I have used the appeal form, but Facebook states in the instructions that they can't lift the restriction or respond to individual messages. So I'm stuck being restricted because someone didn't like my gymnastics posts about being happy for Simone Biles and Aly Raisman winning? Are you kidding?"
