Is there another way I can report a problem because I can't figure it out. \n\nThe problem I am having is on of my pages , none of my posts are showing up on the home page for me personally (I can if I view them as a visitor or go to posts. Shouldn't I be able to see all the posts on the home page (I can see them on other pages I manage).?  I sent a message through this page and haven't heard a response."
