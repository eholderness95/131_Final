It wasnt removed. I thought it was illegal to take pictures of people's kids and put them online without permission, it's definitely a creepy thing to do. Beginning to wonder what a page or person has to say or do on here to be removed."

I can snap your pictures in public and use them since it was taken in public, but you can use the consent form. But in general you can't really do much, even if the picture is removed, FB is not the only medium of sharing."
