He has submitted his drivers license, and debit card photos to show that it is his page, I know he used a name that everyone knows him by, they asked to change the name and he did that and the page is still down. He's been more than understanding, he has family and friends on there that took a long time to find, now he can't reach them, but some have wrote on his fan page sending the photo of what his old messages now show up as on there end. His case hasn't been updating in the last 3-4days. What is going on, can we please resolve this matter :)"
