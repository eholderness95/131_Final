        "message": "Why was my friends account blocked? He has also uploaded his ID about 20X with no prevailing success. He is not a fake profile and his entire picture albums of all 4 of his children are on his Facebook.  He is a loving father of 4 and Facebook should have contacted him prior to deleting his account. His wife is even listed on his account ad his spouse and if you looked at his profile you would know he is not a fake profile. He works hard and is a gym enthusiast he went from 305lbs last March to 238lbs now. Please unlock his account!"
