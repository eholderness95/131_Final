        "message": "Boils down to don't think everyone you encounter needs to go to the friend zone, or even be accepted as a friend on a Facebook Friend Request.  I use to accept any friend.  Was to dumb to decline.  Had to really change my settings.  Only accept friend requests that show at least 4 friends in common.  If not 4, I decline requests.  NO problems with any FB friends now at all.  Very cautious now in having any friend that I feel won't enjoy being friends with me my husband and our grown kids.  Now, no drama with any.  Life is GREAT with our limited friends.  Be cautious.  NO FRIEND ZONE EXISTS!"
