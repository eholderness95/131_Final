When I was a young girl my mother told me to never write anything down on paper that I didn't want the whole world to see.  That was before, obviously, the techology that we have now.  I consider that EVERYTHING I writenon FB or my computer is open to the world.  I would never assume that anything is private - because once you click that button, there it is.  Save your private stuff for other ways of communication."

I also dont like how certain pages i consistently like will all of a sudden stop showing up and others start showing up.. As far as the privacy concern go... If i post on fb id like my stuff to stay on fb. I dont like my info sold for their own benefit. \nFor the rest of you here is a example for you. Theres days i do not like my car, a very nice one ill add... I dont just up and trade it in. Im sure theres days you dont like your spouses, do you go file for divorce? Apples and oranges but anyone with a little common sense will understand what im saying. God bless you all."
