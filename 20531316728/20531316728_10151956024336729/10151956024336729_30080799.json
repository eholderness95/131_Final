You encourage me to use the friend finder to look up old contacts in msn, and then you punish me for doing so. \n\nObviously not everybody will remember me, but most do. Just the fact that they were imported from my msn proves that I knew them at \n\none time. Why do you encourage people to use the friend finder and then punish them for doing so? I know I shouldn't bother people I \n\ndon't know and I don't. But I did know them at one time. Why don't you make an exception for importing friends from msn and not \n\npunish them since it is proven that they were known at one time since they are already on the list? Capisci?"
