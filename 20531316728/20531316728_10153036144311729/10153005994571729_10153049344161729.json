We know it will take some time to adjust to using a second app, and we've tried to make it as convenient as possible: once you install Messenger, you'll still see message notifications in the Facebook app, in the same place where you're used to seeing them. Tapping the notification will take you into the Messenger app, and you can easily switch back and forth. \n-Chantal"
