You just block my account and until i type in something you deem legit i cant access my account. Now i am displaying A FAKE NAME, which is what YOUR POLICY is against. Again I ask, and please answer me instead of copying a link: WHAT PROOF DO YOU HAVE THAT MY NAME WAS NOT REAL TO START WITH? Did you look at my ID? Run my social security number? NO. YOU ARE VIOLATING YOUR OWN POLICY. How about instead of copying some link that has nothing to do with my problem, actually look into it OR let me change my name BACK TO WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE!!!!????"
