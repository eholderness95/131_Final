        "message": "Dear Facebook, I would love to tag my hubby in pics, but you just locked him out of his account because he uses his art name instead of his real name. In my opinion, even if you are trying to encourage people to use their legal names, this is an absurd way to treat your users. Perhaps you could reach out to them first, give deadlines and explanations instead of LOCKING THEM OUT until one of your minions verifies their identity. Yes, I realize that FB is a free service, but we pay for it by enduring a growing number of advertisements, privacy issues and ever-changing algorithms and news feeds. So, perhaps in turn, you could show a little decency and communicate with users about these changes in one of your sponsored feeds before changing the locks to their account."
