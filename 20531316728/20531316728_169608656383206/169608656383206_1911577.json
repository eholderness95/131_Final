        "message": "yeah and I'll bet that majority (51%) are under 30.  What about us over 30.  When is Facebook ever going to work correctly?  Over the weekend I couldn't send comments on the posts, today I can't access my friends list, and some gifts aren't being sent from FB to FV an YV, and the notices I get about old gifts is a fib.  What's up FB, when are you going to correct this stuff?  Why won't you let me uncheck \"recent friends\"?"
