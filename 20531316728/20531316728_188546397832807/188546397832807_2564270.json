        "message": "I used to not believe in the saying \"not everyone is meant to goto college\" but now with 3 months left until I get my BA I can vouch that, that saying is true... Now everyone should get a chance to go, but a lot of people do not belong in college... They're not matured enough or legitimately not bright enough for their classes (mostly the mature part)... But I hope this effort helps"
