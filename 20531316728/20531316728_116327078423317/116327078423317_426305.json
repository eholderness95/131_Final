        "message": "How can they find anyone with all the game activity!!!! You need to make a separate game feed page. I have over 450 friends of which at least 300 play fv as do I but I hate seeing all the game activity on my news feed. I have totally lost track of my non playing friends activity. I NEVER see there posts!!!! If there was a separate game feed and a non-game feed we could switch back and forth! Facebook has turned into a gaming site and not a social network and many people are switching to alternative social sites! Get smart FB!"
