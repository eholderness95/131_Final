        "message": "I am Thai. Of course, one of those above and below.. and I also have the same hope like they do.  I know this can ruin the image of my country tragically, but talking justice, that good image is nothing.\n\nI just want to ask for justice.. for the English victims murdered in Koh Tao, Thailand. We cannot let them die for nothing.  We are sure the 2 Burmeses sufferring behind the bars now are just scapegoats. And the real murders just live their lives happily all this time, believing nobody can harm them or put them in jail just because they are powerful and have money.. to put in the hands of those freaking police.\n\nMost people have ignored this case, thinking it has nothing to do with them. But losing ones' lives is nothing at all.\n\nSo, please help us. This crime should be re-investigated. The truth must be revealed. All justice for the two Burmeses and the beautiful spirits of David and Hannah."
