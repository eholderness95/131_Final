        "message": "Sorry from Thailand \n\nT_T sorry from Thailand.\nI'm here today not because I'm Thai but because we all are humans of the world.\nWe want to ask for justice to victims who were murdered in Ko Tao as we want the investigation to be transparent. It's not only that but also for 2 burmese who were tortured to confess.\nWe don't want money to become the justice and the guilty person(s) still can walk free without any charges. We are so desperate from the system in this country, so we want the world know that there are many voices of the people here that want this case to be solved. Please help us, please give justice to Hannah and David\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1529241560647274&id=100006843348194"
