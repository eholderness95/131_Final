        "message": "how very true, especially when you live so far out in the country! its like 30 miles to the nearest town!  when you are trying to live a christian life, some people avoid you like you have the plaque.  but, you know what?  when its all said and done, its a happier life. i dont miss going to the bars and drinking, i do good to walk when im straight, let alone being stoned out of my brain!!! i thank my oldest son, jake, for buying this i- pad for Chritmas because i have seasonal depression, being disabled limits my activity and walking in snow really cages me in, my good friend some how turned out to be not such a good friend so this winter will be even harder. i always wonder if i will live to see spring. so, i will ask every body who believes in prayer that the Lord strengthens me, open my friends eyes and let her see how special she is to me. thanks friends,     frog"
