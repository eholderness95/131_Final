It's not only that but also \nfor 2 burmese who were tortured to confess. \n\nWe don't want to \nlet money become justice and guilty person still live peacefully without\nany charges. We are so desperate from system in the country,so, we want\nthe world know that there are voices of people that want this case to \nbe cleared. Please help us, please give justice to Hannah and David"
