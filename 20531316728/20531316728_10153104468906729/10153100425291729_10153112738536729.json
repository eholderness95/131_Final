It's not only that but also for 2\nburmese who were tortured to confess.\nWe don't want to let money become justice and\nguilty person still live peacefully without any\ncharges. We are so desperate from system in the\ncountry,so, we want the world know that there are\nvoices of people that want this case to be cleared.\nPlease help us, please give justice to Hannah and\nDavid"
