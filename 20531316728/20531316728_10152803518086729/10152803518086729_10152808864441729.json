        "message": "The world cup is an event that brings people together, where strangers are hugged, tears of joy and tears of loss are shed. Where compassion is felt for the looser, and where the winners celebrate. Terrorists put down arms, criminals stop their crimes, all to watch the beautiful game, that no matter how corrupt, how ridiculous amounts of money are involved, it brings people together, so World let's look at how we bring all this love, compassion and togetherness into our everyday lives. Because football shows, that when there is only one religion for 4 weeks, we all come together. So may whoever is your God, bless you and your team and enjoy 4 weeks of football spirituality. Blessings."
