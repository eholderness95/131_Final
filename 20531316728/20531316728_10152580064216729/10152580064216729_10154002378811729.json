        "message": "Hi, my fan/music page ( www.facebook.com/ClareMeans ) is not showing up in facebook searches when someone searches my name, Clare Means.\n\n(Unless someone has already visited or liked the page) \n\nThe page has existed for over 5 years & has over 3,200 likes so it should be showing up.  \n\nAnd facebook or some someone else has created some other page in my name that shows up instead. \n\nCan you please fix this immediately?  \nI've emailed & contacted facebook many times about this. \n\nAnd can you combine the mystery page with my real page so that people that liked the mystery page will be connected to my real page.  \n\nThis has been going on for a while now & is really bothersome.  \n\nThank you so much for your help!\nClare"
