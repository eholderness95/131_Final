        "message": "Dear World,\n\nIf you are wondering why there is so much BLACK-OUT PROFILE PICTURE, Because we Malaysian, deep in our hearts, feel that democracy for Malaysia is dead.\n\nThis is the darkest day of our life, since May 13, 1969. The new generations feel this and for sure, this will be our history. Not in our textbook, as our voice is silenced. But we will tell the younger generation.\n\nTo remember this day, And one day we will fight back, Resistance Force. Please share this with your friends. One love.\n\nFrom,\nMalaysians."
