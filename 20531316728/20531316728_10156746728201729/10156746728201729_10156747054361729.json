I come from similar background, started my first job at walmart 6 years ago, minimum wage graveyard shift, and at the time I was very grateful because I couldnt find any job and I had language barriers. Now I'm a civil engineer and working in a very competitive business that many students with my situation would struggle to make it. If it wasn't for the 100s of rejections I got and all the pointless attempts and tries I had, eventually I made it up the scale, and continue to aim for more success. Best wishes, and hope for continuous success in your journey, and hope to see your next story after opening a restaurant or restaurants. Stay motivated."
