We're all created by a supreme being; & this is  &  (will  be my personal belief) however it does nothing to reach & teach the human race to embrace what is love, what is true, what is within every human nature to love, protect, nurture each one of us on this earth unless we as humans display &Very sadly many who fall under \"Their judgmental, sad umbrellas i the name of ANY religion\" do so much to create separation, ignorance & that it's sooo sad & devastating to the thought process of the human raceWE ALL need to be in deep tought about how to change the human race, our earth & in my opinion,lovin sometimes people we don't personally believe our love, not be judgmental or bully. In place, we can make every attempt to understand (all people have issues & are usually worse than out own.
