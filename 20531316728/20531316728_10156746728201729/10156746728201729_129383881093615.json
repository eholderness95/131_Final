I don\u2019t have too much experience in using Business Manager and I gave her access as a Page Advertiser (on this business). In a few minutes all my page admins were removed and I\u2019ve lost access to my facebook page. Now I do understand that I was dumb, but how someone with Page Advertiser rights (in facebook business manager) can remove me as an admin in my own fb page? And if he can do that, why this note is not available? ''Note: If you're a new admin, keep in mind that you may need to wait 7 days before you can remove or demote another admin.'' Is this normal? . I really need to recover my page because all I have done was to add someone as Page Advertiser on FB Business Manger. Thank You!"
