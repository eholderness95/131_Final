        "message": "I work in a high school, Our custodial staff works hard to try to keep the campus clean. many of the students don't help the situation- garbage in the water fountains, trash all over campus, garbage on the ground in front of the garbage can, I haven't even seen the cafeteria after lunch, but I hear it is pretty bad. This week our :campus \"news program\" did a piece on the state of our bathrooms. garbage all over the floors. I KNOW our staff works hard and I have seen the lack of care regarding the state of the campus by our youth. In the program one student blamed the condition of the campus on the custodians and other staff. He felt we should just be there to meet the whims of students. I was gisgusted by that attitude. Some of us pick up garbage very day as we walk down the halls.  I appreciate that someone has seen this and is making moves to enlighten others to the \"Unsung Heroes\""
