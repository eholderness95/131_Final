        "message": "Fantastic. Why not celebrate this young man's efforts? He's doing something positive. As a young man, my husband worked in the cafeteria of the university where his father was a professor. He bused tables and learned jive talk. He got friendly with the football players and spread his knowledge of how others grow up, persevere. It never hurts to try to understand others. I love this kind of outreach."
