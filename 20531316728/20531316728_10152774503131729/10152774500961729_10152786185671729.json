        "message": "Please, I am hoping someone can help me. My sister passed away in February and I have tried memorializing her page. My mother and my sister's friends DO NOT need to be getting reminders of her upcoming birthday, etc. I do not want her page removed; I want it memorialized so those reminders and friend suggestions do not happen and cause my family pain. \n\nI have followed the instructions to memorialize her page about three or four times now and I get a message saying I will be emailed. However, I have never been emailed. PLEASE, I am trying to get this taken care of before my sister's birthday in August. PLEASE help me!"
