        "message": "The poem of the awesome ground breaking lady I loved the best was Still I rise. Here are a few words. Does my sassiness upset you? \nWhy are you beset with gloom? \n'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells\nPumping in my living room.\n\nJust like moons and like suns,\nWith the certainty of tides,\nJust like hopes springing high,\nStill I'll rise.\n\nDid you want to see me broken? \nBowed head and lowered eyes? \nShoulders falling down like teardrops.\nWeakened by my soulful cries.\n\nDoes my haughtiness offend you? \nDon't you take it awful hard\n'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines\nDiggin' in my own back yard.\n\nYou may shoot me with your words,\nYou may cut me with your eyes,\nYou may kill me with your hatefulness,\nBut still, like air, I'll rise."
