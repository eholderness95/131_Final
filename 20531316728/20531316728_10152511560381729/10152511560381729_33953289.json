You made me cry (happy/sad) tears...the first picture was my Dad, who walked on in 2008, and one of the last pictures was my beautiful cousin Jean (Dad's niece) who walked on a few years before him, with a picture of my brother (lost in 2007) and myself as children, happy memories.  Awesome, just awesome."
