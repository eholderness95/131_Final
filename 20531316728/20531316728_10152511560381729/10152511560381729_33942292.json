        "message": "There are many who have negative spins regarding Facebook, and I understand that, but for me it has brought so many, many people from every corner of my life back into my circle, there is something so wonderful about keeping those connections within reach at any given time. I have had to opportunity to hold several reunions with people I thought I had lost from my life due to FB. For me it is a way to connect family and friends new and old. Thank you Facebook! I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg had no idea what beautiful things it could eventually do for so many!"
