Because you want the page owner to promote their posts or their page by paying money..... I can almost understand the reason, if the page is selling a product, but the rest of us that have nothing to sell on our page, our fans should be able to see all posts. It's sad that is all about money for Facebook.... It wasn't that way when they started. Pathetic!!"
