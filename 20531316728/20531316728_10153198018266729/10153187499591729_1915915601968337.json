        "message": "Facebook is great. It has excellent custom settings in which you can choose who sees what you post. I tested this out with a FB friend some time ago just to be sure...I posted something random and told her what to look for. Indeed, she could not find my post. I'm very selective in who I share things with so I always depend on this feature."
