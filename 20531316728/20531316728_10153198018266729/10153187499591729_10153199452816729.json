        "message": "What u don't want others to know certain things than u keep yer topics minimal. What I write I write to share certain things. Believe me I hate Facebook wars n that should be kept private, other than that a lot of the things I talk about is God, pain physically n mentally, hurt due to sarcastic individuals from years past n for some reason I loath braggers it's sometimes unnecessary n really doesn't prove much about the person doing it. Now if that makes me a bad person or  disrespectful I'm truly sorry.I love n respect family on my side n on my husband's side n I try not to hurt any one of them. So if there is something private......WHY IN THE LORD'S NAME POST IT!!!!!!!!"
