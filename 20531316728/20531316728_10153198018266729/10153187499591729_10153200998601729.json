No one cares if I go like a page or someone else's picture (especially friends who don't even know that person) . That doesn't need to show up in everyone news feed. Same for comments. I don't want to see my friend comment on everything especially groups they are in or pages they like. I want to see status updates. Recent ones all the time and not top stories."
