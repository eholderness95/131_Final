            "message": "I've had a private photo stolen from me and used on a businesses page. It's been over 8 hours since I submitted my copyright infringment request to take it down. What gives? This photo is mine, of my twin sons on a skeezy page. They are minors and I did not authorize the use of this photo on their like page. Now some random person in Eqypt is using my photo of my kids as their profile picture and it's been shared almost 300 times. I am the photographer, they are my children and want it removed. WHO CAN HELP ME? I tried calling the number in your FAQ and I got routed to a place where I was hung up on. I feel like my children are in danger, people are claiming that my kids are their own. This is scaring me. This photo was set to friends only, I have no idea how they obtained the photo. Here is the link to the page.
