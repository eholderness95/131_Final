        "message": "The face book help site is useless !!!! I have been trying for over a month now to report something that disturbs me greatly and the help site just keeps going in circles. I am being harrassed and had my personal information shared by someone I do not know. This is not acceptable to me. If there is an actual person that works at facebook then I need to talk to someone. I seriously doubt that this post will even be read but I am going to continue to try and get in touch with someone that can assist me. Why doesnt facebook have an email address that we can use to report this kind of problem?????"
