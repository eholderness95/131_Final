        "message": "Dear Mr. Zuckerberg, a friend of mine who lost his wife to lung cancer just shared your post about Facebook joining the fight against Ebola. As a person who has lost several family members and friends to lung cancer I must join my friend Scott Reid and invite you and the Facebook community to join a cause that is a true threat to the citizens of the US. 160,000 lives will be lost to lung cancer this year and this statistic has not changed in the last 30 years. Lung cancer affects not only Americans, it is the leading cause of cancer deaths around the world. You are in a unique and fortunate position to create a national dialogue around lung cancer. I encourage you, in the month of November which is lung cancer awareness month to honor those who we have lost to this devastating disease."
