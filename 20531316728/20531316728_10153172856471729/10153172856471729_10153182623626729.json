You argument doesn't hold because VA hasn't done the job and our government is spending more to fight Ebola than fixing the VA. The point is FB can direct appropriate donate requests based on location and supporting wounded warriors or similar on the eve if Veterans Day would be more powerful for a USA user.  This could be a powerful fundraiser if it wasn't so misguided by political optics."
