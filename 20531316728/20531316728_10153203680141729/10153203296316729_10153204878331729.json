To download a sticker pack on your computer, open a chat, click on the smile in the lower right hand corner of the chat, click on the basket (Sticker Store) in the upper right hand corner of your sticker window and download any desired sticker packs. Hope this helps! http://on.fb.me/1xSY5xq  -Elissa"
