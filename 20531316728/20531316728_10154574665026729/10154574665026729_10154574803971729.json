        "message": "It is just terrible what FaceBook has done\u2014and not just to me but everyone who has multiple pages under a main account.  Because my guy created my fashion page off of his account, in the past I would simply log on to his identity and click a link that would open my Original Fashionista page.  Both were kept separate.  Now that FB has combined them as one account\u2014even though my fashion page still looks the same\u2014when messages are sent they are now all in one place and has become impossible to know if the person sending the message is one of my guy\u2019s friends or one of my fashion gals.  I just wish FB would put things back as they were before.  I am getting ready to stop all my advertising dollars with Facebook.  Isn\u2019t there anyone out there that can help me with this issue?"
