        "message": "I am being harassed for the past several months from a scam spam page on Facebook. I have blocked the page, unfollowed the post and reported the page DAILY and yet you still allow this to happen. Every single day 30-40 a day I receive notifications from this page of people I don't know nor want to know that are posting on this scam site. If you block a page and unfollow a post that should be the end of it and you should never have to see those notifications EVER again. This is harassment I suggest you do something about it.\n\nHere is the page/event page in question. PLEASE fix this issue it is so annoying to see all these notifications I have no use for.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/681950895280513/permalink/681950901947179/"
