Here's the message that pops up when we try to log on: \"Unfortunately, you won't be able to access your account while we're reviewing these additional documents. We appreciate your patience, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.\" How long does it take to \"review documents\"? Getting at least an email would be nice. Any help?"
