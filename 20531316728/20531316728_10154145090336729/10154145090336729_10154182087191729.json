        "message": "Dear Facebook---\n\nOn Sunday, the account of \"West Phillie Produce\" was abruptly closed.\n\n\"West Phillie Produce\" is a community hub and also a produce grocer in the Philadelphia area.  Closing this account with no explanation feels like bullying and marginalization of an entire community of people.  The account contains historical accounts of community programs dating back for several years.\n\nPlease review this decision and re open the account.  \n\nCc: Arnett Woodall"
