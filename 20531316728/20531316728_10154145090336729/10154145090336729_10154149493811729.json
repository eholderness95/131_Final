I would love to do for my child exactly what Karen is doing for her kids, and be involved in a science program to help reach my degree dreams all the while exploring opportunities with my daughter in tow. All I want to do is get back in school, work, and be a role model for my daughter.\nHow can I help make this opportunity become reality?"
