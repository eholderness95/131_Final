        "message": "I am very frustrated with facebook. Can I understand what motive is behind the idea of not being able to TAG people or even other business pages on my business page? The whole point of a business is to be able to TAG and share. It does not make sense to have to add people on personal facebook so that I can tag them on a business page. Business pages need to SERIOUSLY be updated. They are not user friendly and not helpful to our business but rather make things more a hassle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
