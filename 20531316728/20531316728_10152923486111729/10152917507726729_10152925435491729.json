        "message": "Yo Facebook, just got your email that you're dropping messaging from the Facebook app and only providing messaging on Messenger app - I really dont get that.  I've used Messenger app before and found it buggy and just an unnecessary extra app.  I dont care about all the extra messaging features, and majority of users dont - so why not continue to at least support text-based messages via regular app.  Your apps are bloated .... the regular app on my droid its 37MB installation  + 116MB data + cache (mine at the moment is 27MB and easily approaches 100mb if I dont dump it regularly).  And your apps dont support installing on SD Card - so unless everyone's got a top of the line phone with lots of internal memory - you make it challenging to keep/use your apps."
