        "message": "Your idea to force everyone to use the messenger app is HORRIBLE! I like being able to browse Facebook and chat at the same time!!! I have NO desire to switch back and forth between 2 apps...which is why I never downloaded it in the first place!!! Forcing us to use it just to boost you app numbers is ridiculous!!! Nice way to NOT put your users first. If we all wanted to use it we wouldn't have all ignored your irritating reminders!!  This is a HORRIBLE idea!!"
