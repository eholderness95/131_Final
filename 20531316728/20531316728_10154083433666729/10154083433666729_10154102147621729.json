        "message": "As an ADHD obsessive personality Facebook is probably a bigger time suck than for most people!  I'm so afraid I will miss something!  I spend way too much time scrolling!  I wish you had a place to click to take you back 12 hours on your newsfeed so you didn't have to scroll so much.  Any hope for that feature in the future?  3 hours, 6 hours?  I think it would be a great option."
