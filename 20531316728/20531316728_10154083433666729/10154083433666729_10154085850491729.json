        "message": "I was logged out of my session on Firefox. When I tried to log back in, I got a message that my computer was infected with malware and that I needed to download some software and run a scan. I scanned my computer with my existing virus software and there were no threats. I immediately changed my password, however, I continue to get the malware message when I attempt to login using Firefox. I do not get any malware message logging in via Internet Explorer. Should I be concerned that my account has been somehow compromised? I have all my security settings as tight as possible, including getting the text message code every time I log in and I never save the browser, so every time I log out, I need to enter the code to log back in."
