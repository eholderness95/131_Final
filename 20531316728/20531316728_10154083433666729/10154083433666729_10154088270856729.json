        "message": "Facebook not sure where I can go to chime in on my opinion, but this new programming you have where I get an email for every single notification I'm signed up for is horrible. Can you please make it go back to the way it was. I want to continue to get the notifications for the things I have posted on but not for all the pages I clicked on to be notified of. That can remain the way it was with no email notification. I now either have to go one by one and unsubscribe to everything page I subscribe to or I  have to completely turn off my notifications which means I won't get notified for the threads I am on."
