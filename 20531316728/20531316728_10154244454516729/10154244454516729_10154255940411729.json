Was given a website listed below: you advise to contact the Facebook disbursement for your claim right now with this email address    Facebookdisbursement@instruction.com,facebookwinner075@gmail.com just contact them now so that they can tell you how you can get your winning. You are about to log in to the site \"instruction.com\" with the username \"facebookdisbursement\", but the website does not require authentication. This may be an attempt to trick you. Is \"instruction.com\" the site you want to visit?    Once I got to this message, I stopped, for I knew it somehow good be a scam. I'm pretty sure if I was a Facebook winner I'd be notified via a safe and secure website.  I'd like to know if this was a scam???"
