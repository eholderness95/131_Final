She claims to be a Facebook agent and has \"informed\" me that I just won 500,000.00 from Facebook by being #14 on a list of random people's facebook profiles that was chosen to win.  She is requesting my full home address, my email address, phone number, Full name and Occupation.  Is this real? or is it a scam?"
