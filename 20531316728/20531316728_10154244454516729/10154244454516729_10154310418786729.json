        "message": "Mark Zuckerberg, I doubt you will see this, but I'm tired of seeing the same posts over and over when i get off Facebook and go back on in a few minutes. Is there a way that you can have the development team implement a \"read\" and \"unread\" option like emails so that when it is read the next unread post shows up first the next time you open the app on your phone? Thanks!"
