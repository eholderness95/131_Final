Is it true.\nI thought it was a hoax at first but saw this on Good Morning America and the news so I'll share for a shot at it....\nTHANK YOU, MARK ZUCKERBERG, for your forward-thinking generosity! And congrats on becoming a dad!\nMark Zuckerberg has announced that he is giving away $45 billion of Facebook stock. What you may not have heard is that he plans to give 10% of it away to people like YOU and ME! All you have to do is copy and paste this message into a post IMMEDIATELY. At midnight PST, Facebook will search through the day's posts and award 1000 people with $4.5 million EACH as a way of saying thank you for making Facebook such a powerful vehicle for connection."
