I need to hide my friends list but when I go to my friends tab or try to access my friends list via any other link I can't see it to click edit etc. It doesn't populate. All I get below my cover/profile pic is a big blank screen. I can't find where to get tech support for this. I've logged out and rebooted but the problem still persists. What do I do? Thanks!!1"
