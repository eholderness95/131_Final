I looked up her account and she does exist. However, somebody using her name said I had won a lottery from FB in the amount of $600,000 USD (that they used USD made me suspicious, as that is the phrasing the Nigerian scammers use). They then said I had to visit your HQ in Menlo Park, CA or pay an Administrative and Delivery Fee of ONLY $300.00. I've been around long enough to be able to smell a scam like this a mile away. I have two questions: it's a hoax, correct? Also, does Ms. Kirsten need to take steps to protect her account? Thanks."
