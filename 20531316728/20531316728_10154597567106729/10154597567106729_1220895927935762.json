        "message": "I have been telling an older friend of mine he should get on Facebook for some time.  Recently, I was visiting him and he asked me to set him up with an account.  It turned out that someone (I think his grandson) had already done so, but neither of the passwords he said were the only ones he ever used were correct.  I tried establishing one under another variation of his name, but it wouldn't let me!  Now he has asked me to ask you what he can do to set up an account on Facebook.  Thanks for any help you can give!"
