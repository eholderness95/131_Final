        "message": "Totally different subject but I have been trying to find help with the following issue.....I am trying to fix my settings so I can save videos/posts to a saved folder. I have found instructions but the save option does not come up and I do not have a saved folder. Help!!!! I know I'm doing it correctly because I can save videos if I log in under my husband's account....just not mine. I have not been able to find any help on this issue. I can only assume it is a setting problem."
