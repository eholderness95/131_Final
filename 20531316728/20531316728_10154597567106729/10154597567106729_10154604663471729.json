        "message": "Two days ago Taliban attacked in Kabul that killed and injured more than 400 Afghans mostly civilians, including children and women. \n\nSo I have a question to ask you Mark. Dear Mark, what is the difference between Paris, Brussels and Kabul? Why Facebook is not showing grief to Afghanistan? And why safety check is not activated so that people know about their loved ones? \n\nI hope you are not being biased, and I request you to please activate safety check in Afghanistan. Thank you for your great services!\n\nI look forward to your reply.\n\nPress like button if you care; it should be delivered to Facebook"
