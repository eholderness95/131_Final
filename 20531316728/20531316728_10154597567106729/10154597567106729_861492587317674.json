        "message": "Hello Facebook,  how truth is that Anton Grasia works for you?  He is claiming to be your worker and who can delete fake dpages and fake accounts.  My concern is....  People are postings their concerns on Facebook Security page looking for help and this person Anton Grasia and his friends from Indonesia are accusing people on doing false pages or accounts just because their post their comments asking for help.  I don't think this is professional of them in Accusing people their there to help the users.  I don't think people will go there to ask for help if they are guilty knowing that you can verify is the page belongs to the person or someone else also these employees can check if this person using names and picture from another person.  \n\nI don't think people will be that stupid on reporting pages or accounts if these are theirs.\n\nCan you please check on the guy Anton Grasia he has at least five accounts and I sent you a picture of his accounts by inbox."
