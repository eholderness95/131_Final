I have contacted support team many times and submitted many documents for the re-enabling of my ad account but neither team nor any other person replyed to my support request , neither through support page nor through email . My question is simple if you are not able to reply to my support request why do you always shows that you will contact with me through email or support request. I need your team's personal assistant in this matter as i am really desperate now coz it's been 4 months and i am still unable to get any satisfied reply on your behalf . Please get back to me ASAP .\nThanks !!!"
