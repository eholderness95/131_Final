        "message": "Being a booklover for more than six decades, every day is book day for me, but it's nice that someone is at least giving one day to the celebration of reading! My picks are: the dictionary (I have six different ones, and use them all), where so many wonderful words reside; a good thesaurus (I have three); \"The Old Man And The Boy\" by Robert Ruark, a classic about a youngster spending summers at his grandparents' place; and \"Freckles\" by Gene Stratton-Porter (most of her books are wonderful). I do lean toward non-fiction, but the geographic perspective painted in \"word pictures\" by Zane Grey (his descriptions of the West enabled me to actually recognize Green River, Wyoming, the first time I saw it!) is amazing."
