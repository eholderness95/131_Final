        "message": "I love Facebook for the convenience of being able to talk and share pictures of my kids with family that is far away. I do. That being said... I HATE facebook for NOT helping people with their problems that actually concern facebook! I have tried reporting issues. I have tried messaging facebook myself. NO RESPONSES. If the only way I can get their attention is by posting comments on all their posts for the world to see so be it. A woman who is unrelated to me is posting pictures of my 5 year old daughter to her Facebook wall. 5 years old. Pictures that I took. I don't know how she got them because my profile is private, but she did and there they are. For months now she's had my daughters pictures on her wall. Not only is this copyright infringement, it is also SICK AND DISTURNING that my 5 year old daughters pictures are on this psychos wall. I have tried messaging her. I have tried reporting the photo and Facebook won't do a THING to respond to me, or take them down. Careful out there people.. if yiu have kids, Facebook enables other users to post your children and will not help you if you catch it."
