        "message": "I have quite a dilemma. It concerns a Facebook page Rebel Partners in Crime. I ordered 5 rebel crosses from them for $100.00 paid through PayPal on April 4, 2016. I have never received  my items. They also have the page Rebel Delights which are both run by Marie Case. I had been staying in\ncontact with them over the past couple weeks through fb messenger and last I heard they were to be shipped to me last Saturday from Texas. I didn't get them. So I was going to send them a message and they had blocked me. So I sent Marie Case a message now she has blocked me. And I have been blocked on the Rebel Delights page now. So I think they just scammed me out of $100.00. I don't think they should be on Facebook doing stuff like that. When they send you a bill through PayPal it is in Marie Cases nephew's name Clark Kirkland. I only got her name off the email listed with the PayPal that was that received my payment."
