        "message": "Spiritually, Across River Jordan I find hope of righteousness! Great faithfuls of God -Joshua and Caleb crossed River Jordan to holy promises of God's physical leadership and providence. Across River Jordan, Prophet Elijah ascended to heaven and Elisha received the power of holy spirit to perform miracles. Across River Jordan, John the Baptist first preached the coming of the Messiah and declared Jesus as the Lamb of God. Across river Jordan Jesus the Messiah was baptised, declared son of God and the world should listen to him and the Jesus received the holy spirit for his ministry. Across spiritual River Jordan through the baptism of the holy spirit shall I and you ascend to heavenly Canaan where the Original city of the Jerusalem built on heavenly Mt. Zion is! I love, Lord God  bless you. Thomas"
