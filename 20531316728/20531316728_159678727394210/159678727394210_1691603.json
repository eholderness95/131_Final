        "message": "When are we going to get something to put our candy in for Halloween? You shouldn't put it out till there is a place to go with it! I have some saved as well as some other things! I have my house ready and I'm wanting to go!\n\nI was disappointed to get just a balloon for all the work I did for Haiti! There should have been something neat for those of us who got their 150 School Supplies! Balloons for thoses who tried! We don't need an other set of birds and cage, altho I really like them! Thank you! Viv Honicutt"
