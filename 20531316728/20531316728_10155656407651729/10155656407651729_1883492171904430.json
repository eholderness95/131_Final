        "message": "I have another question about updates.  On my phone new notifications have this great little blue dot. On my iPad, new notifications are a noticeably darker shade of blue then old seen notifications.  These are great.  On my computer seen notifications are white and new notifications are just a very very very slight shade of blue.  I have to keep adjusting the angle of my monitor to see them.  Any chance this can be adjusted in my settings or perhaps those lovely little blue dots might be coming to the web based FB?  (Seriously, those dots rock.)"
