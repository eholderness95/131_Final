        "message": "My dear Facebook awesome people...I love the way you encourage feedback which, of course, is very wise of you. For that reason I will make a suggestion. During the tragic landslides Peruvian people had to endure for weeks until a few days ago, I tried to get input from The Peruvian Embassy in Washington DC. related to the logistics for goods donations. I was getting myself ready to launch a campaign within my community. The Peruvian Public Service Office - Embassy - completely ignored my questions just like those from many others. That's not acceptable. Im not done with them yet but I wanted to set something on my post like the \" Indifference counter\" to exposed and count the days of complete disregard for the community inquieres and the people willing to help their brothers and sisters. I though a tool like this could be set up also to show expectation...for birthdays or any special occasion as well. Best!"
