        "message": "Facebook HQ HELP! I see there are many of us without being able to upload photos to our pages, this has been going on for days and is more than just a nuisance. We have our personal page, community pages and perhaps group pages that need daily photos posted. 'error messages' daily with no solution? I have gone thru your process of reporting the problem to no avail; PLEASE find the error and fix the issue ASAP, much appreciated. Thank you. Looking forward to posting everything soon!"
