            "message": "Hi Maddy. There are a few steps you'll need to take in order to merge your Pages. First, ensure that whoever is performing the merge is an admin for both Pages. Next, if your Pages have physical locations, make sure the addresses are the same. Lastly, please keep in mind that a Page merge is only available for Pages that represent the same thing, so consider making the Page category the same on both Pages. Once you have taken these steps, you may be able to merge your Pages by following these instructions: http://bit.ly/2o969Ot. -Jessica"
