        "message": "I've commented before about the popup window scam on Facebook that tells you that your phone is infected and tries to get you to download an antivirus app, and if you're too slow it starts downloading a file to your phone. I just deleted the 23rd file that this scam has downloaded to my phone. Sometimes there is a variant that tells you that you have won and prompts you to spin a wheel to determine your prize. That one doesn't download a file. With all your technical might and resources, why does this keep happening? Are you powerless to stop this? I can't get on Facebook for more than 10 or 15 minutes without this happening. Does everybody experience this, or is the number of people targeted by this clearly illegal scam too small to concern you?"
