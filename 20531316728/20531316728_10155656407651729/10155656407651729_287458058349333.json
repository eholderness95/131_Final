        "message": "Congrats on the new camera! Quick question, recently I noticed I wasn't getting any sound on Facebook videos when watching on my iMac. I don't have this issue when watching videos on other sites like Youtube, Netflix, etc. And I don't have this issue when watching FB videos on my Android phone, only when watching on the iMac. Any suggestions on how to fix? Thank you!"
