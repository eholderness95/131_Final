Android phones have had a system for sorting photos into categories for several years now. I can page through my photos from Facebook, pictures I've downloaded from my web browser, photos I've taken with my camera, photos I've saved from other apps, etc. Other apps I use are aware of this and make finding the picture I'm looking for way easier. Another problem when searching through pictures to post to FB is they get scrambled into seemingly random order. A few of my most recent photos will show up at the top, but eventually they will end up somewhere in the middle or even tword the bottom. Please address this issue. I'm surprised it's still going on tbh."
