His profile picture was just one of famous sportsperson of bangladesh. His email was verified, so was his phone number. He just trying to contact with you by email but he have not got any response. In that case what should he do? He already appealed for getting his account back and provided you his passport photo and picture. But its been 36+ hours, he have not got any response from you, nor he got his id back. Can you give him any suggestion? Please answer."
