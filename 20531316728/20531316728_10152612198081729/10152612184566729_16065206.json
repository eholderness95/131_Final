I would also like for there to be an option so I can decide if I want something changed , NOT YOU!!!  I don't care what status or pictures or pages my \"friends\" like or comment on and I definitely hate that they see every single thing I like or comment on and what's the point of having my page private if their friends get to see what they're commenting on if they're commenting on my page.. It's annoying , it's all around annoying.. You guys just keep altering things that don't need any altering .. LEAVE IT ALONE ALREADY!!"
