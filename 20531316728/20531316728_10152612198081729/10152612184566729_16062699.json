Increasingly.  I just read today that the next change (already in the works) will result in only about 1-2% of my \"fanbase\" being \"reached\" organically.  And that's the number of people on whose feed a post appears at all, not the number of people who actually interact with it.  Facebook advertising used to be a better deal than a lot of the other options... that is rapidly becoming no longer true."

And, why you see many asking for 'chronological order' b/c when selecting 'most recent' it should be just that MOST RECENT in chronological order.
