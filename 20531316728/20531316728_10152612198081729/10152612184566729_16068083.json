I can tell that you are more interested in displaying ads (which make you money) than you are about the users needs.  It's all about the almighty dollar..... At least let us decide what we want to see and what we don't want to see by letting us close items and columns we don't use.  I think it's time for us to make a change to a new social network site.  Anyone know of any good ones?"

Myspace use to rock. I may be only a few, but they let us do what we wanted to our own page."
