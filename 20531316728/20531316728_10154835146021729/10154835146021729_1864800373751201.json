I keep getting a constant pop-up from the site for a feature I barely use. I've dug through my security settings and everything seems alright...\n\nExcept I can't find a single thing.\n\nTo stop you from continuing to e-mail me.\n\n100 times or more an hour.\n\nFor no apparent reason.\n\nFor the same supposed reason.\n\nI can't find anyone to contact, not a single report works. When will it stop? What do I need to do?"

If I have my e-mails syncing on my mobile, or Facebook open in any fashion on my phone or laptop, it constantly grabs focus. And it's made every single website that uses a Facebook commenting section at the bottom grab focus to send me a pop-up. They replied once, to a single mode of contact in an hour. Asking for my E-mail address. Which they already have. They couldn't be bothered to check on their attack which officially reached the level of a DOS on my poor internet connection because we live outside of good service. And here I sit, they didn't bother to look into it, not a thing is fixed. The extent of their effort has been to ask what my e-mail address is and do nothing on their side wanting an answer to a question they already have the answer to."

Contacting them is an almost impossibility, getting an answer is worse, they don't even answer the majority of their help questions in their own Help section.
