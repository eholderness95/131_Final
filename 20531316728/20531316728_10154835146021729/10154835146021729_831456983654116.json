I can count at least 10 \"Selling\" groups with pages in my area. I attempted to sell a personal belonging on them and in turn received an unnecessary restriction that now prevents me from posting in or joining groups. I am currently the creator /administrator of a support group for moms in my area and I cannot even partake in my group due to this restriction. I would GREATLY appreciate some assistance in this matter as my appeals are going nowhere. Thank you!"
