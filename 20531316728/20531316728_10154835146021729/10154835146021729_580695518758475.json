And right now, it has only flown for 90 minutes which far surpassed the 30 minutes it was supposed fly for. \nAquila will be able to cover a region of 60 miles in diameter at 60,000ft.\nSo more of these Aquilas will be needed to cover the 4 billion people who still are not connected.\nIt will be a fantastic way to cover all those 4 billion people but it will take time. It is not a working project yet.....it is a work still in testing.....but it will be a good thing when more are up flying. There will be needed overlapping flights because it will ONLY last 3 months.\nThe longest unmanned solar flight lasted 2 weeks and that was NOT Aquila.....that was a test to see how long an unmanned solar flight could stay in flight.\nIts still in testing folks...it is not working now.\nI read about Aquila in the link provided in this discussion.\nRead it, learn about it, and i am done in this discussion......goodbye"
