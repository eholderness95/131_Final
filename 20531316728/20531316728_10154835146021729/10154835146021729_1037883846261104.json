Here we all sit almost a year and a half later and still crickets from FB.  Our family is so spread out across the globe bc we are all military families and we all cherished our \"diary\" with our mom on FB and they took that from us bc she chooses to use a family nickname on FB bc she lives in a small community and is an older women and well known in her community and she wanted to stay private on FB by using her nickname..  I wish you the best of luck with resolve Marilyn Hopper, as great as FB is, they have a habit of hurting people and don't give two cents when they take memories from those that use FB to stay in touch with loved ones spread far and wide...  we lost 10 years of communication with our mom bc no one cared enough to respond to any of our concerns of closing mom's account"
