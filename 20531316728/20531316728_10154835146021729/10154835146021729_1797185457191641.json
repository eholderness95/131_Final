Satellite internet requires a precisely aimed dish with an unobstructed view, which presents a challenge in the targetted rural areas. This aircraft flying between 60,000 and 90,000 feet could use much simpler ground infrastructure that wouldn't require precise aiming. That altitude is also far above commercial air traffic, and most weather systems. Aircraft will obviously be much closer to the ground than satellites, so there will be less latency, and greater bandwidth should be possible, meaning faster internet. This is actually better than satellites in many regards"

Everything that goes up must come down!! I watched the takeoff or launch as it separated from launch equipment. But how do you land it, and doesn't that tear the aircraft up and require a complete rebuild before it can be used again? Or is the craft expendable and not reused? Thanks!! Keep up the great work! The technology today is endless providing that people/companies continue to explore new opportunities to cash in on the ever changing needs of this vast world we live in!!"
