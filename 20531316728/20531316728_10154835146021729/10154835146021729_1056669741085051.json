        "message": "To think when I was young the only way to communicate was by US mail or by a phone wired and attached to a wall. Now I can keep in contact with anyone anytime especially with Facebook no matter where I'm at in the US. And now you're making that possible in other parts of the world for other people who will enjoy Facebook just as much as myself. Thank you Facebook team for your beautiful minds and tenacity to keep moving forward."
