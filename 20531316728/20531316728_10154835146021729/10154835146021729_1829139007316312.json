I saw that the owner of a company needed some help with their website, and I volunteered to assist. That two hours of help landed me a job for years, still doing it part time as well, all because I was in a Facebook group. Had I not had Facebook, I would've never otherwise met my boss (who I still have yet to meet in person, but talk with all the time through messenger and group :) )"

I had joined a group that was admined by the owner of a company - a company that I'd purchased products from a time or two in the past - so I didn't join the group looking for a job, I joined it because I enjoyed their products and Facebook groups provide a decent platform for customer service and community, at least in some aspects. I came to the group hoping to get more information and may be connect with a few like-minded people. I basically just noticed a post one day and offered to help. I honestly encourage anyone - if there is an online company that you really like, who sells products that you really dig, and stand for something that you'd want to be a part of, the worst they can do is say no if you offer your expertise or assistance (and not just web design, if you don't know anything about coding you could may be offer to keep up their social media stuff or write for their blog once a week, which is where I started off officially after I helped fix their website) and it doesn't hurt to ask. You really never know where an opportunity may lie, or even how those \"many hours scrolling through Facebook\" could actually pay off one day :)"
