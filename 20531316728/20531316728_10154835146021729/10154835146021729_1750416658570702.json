I'm grateful for Facebook, and I'm still a novice at it.\nI was recently pulled into the dark side: As an elderly lady, a Christian, I just finalized a very painful divorce. I am a retired teacher, and a veteran of the US Navy. A man (pseudoperson or persona) requested friendship with me in late June. As a baby Facebook person, I was receiving many requests simultaneously from members of my church, and I also have relatives in New England..church members and family have the same surname as this person. So, without any real  qualms or hesitation, I accepted. In a matter of a month, He proceeded to be more and more charming, then romantic. He poses as an American officer on a peace keeping mission in Syria. A divorced man, in his fifties, with custody of a daughter..It was too fast, something very suspicious, that involved his interest in me romantically and taking s vacation to meet me in person. Lo and behold. he said that he needed permission from his command's \" vacation office\" to fund a NaATO flight to the States. I was to be considered as a host, since he is an officer, there was a different level of procedure. Then, in the middle of the night, the clincher came! The letter from ME to his vacation office via an email address. He explained how I was to type it out. It authorized a trip that cost, bold on to your proverbial hat, $5,000. PLUS a  \"Courier fee\" of $259!!? In other words, I was supposed to send two amounts via email, withdrawn from my savings account.. My reply was to inform him/them that I realized that this is a scam. The con is over. Then, I added that I hope that God will forgive! It is embarrassing! I unfriended, then blocked. Then I contacted you at Facebook. It won't surprise anyone that his name is very common!! \"John Johnson\"..there are oodles of them! I have two email addresses, but just his pseudonym. \nThere we have it. A very nasty taste, some salty old tears. My church family knows what happened, and the elderly women especially are very loving, understanding, and supportive \nFacebook is a blessing. It is a tool, and so amazing! I found two old friends from my childhood, after so many years apart. It is worth it. Thank you for your time and consideration. God bless you, keep up the work you are doing to bring this world closer together. Love is mightier than hate. Hate is darkness, and is consumed by the beauty and truth of Light. Light is Agape Love, and it is a mighty spiritual force!! Shalom!"

Thanks to all made replies but please move forward to making your own comments and pass on an idea that can help others.
