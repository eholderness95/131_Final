        "message": "We are body donors. ANy and all , for the University of Tennessee. A few years ago there were 6 med students working on one body. Its simple to do and they cremate and return the ashes to the family one year from the time they use it. I know God will give me a better body than this ole thing and I wont need it. So you can , if too old for organ donation, donate your body for a med student to learn surgery, and any of the millions of things they need to learn on a body."
