        "message": "Hi, I reported a post from Skagit County Sheriff's Department 7/15 and was sent the blanket response that it didn't violate FBs standards. The post in question has possibly destroyed a man and his small business. It was completely childish and unprofessional nothing of what you would expect of a Sheriff. On top of that, there was a photo of the small business with the business phone number on a sign. Since then this man and his family have received death threats. The sheriff of Skagit County used Facebook as a tool to destroy this man and his business. This was bullying and incites violence. Since there are not many options I'm using the FB page. Please look this up on their page and please look up the many news articles available about this situation."
