        "message": "Going into political conventions it is important to understand--no administration has surpassed Teddy Roosevelt's bull moose progressivism or cousin Eleanor (T.R.'s favorite niece I wonder why) Roosevelt's international consciousness, or FDR's  New Deal. That family has contributed more to the idea of the greatest good for the greatest number. Trump wants the greatest good for himself. Clinton is a regressive faction of the Democratic Party: sclerotic, circa 1920's when the party lost its footing. Horrific that these are the best we have to offer in a particularly divisive nation. And the academics revile me when I suggest we shouldn't prize math so much as the world keeps changing shape each day. Sneak in  a little history, politics, critical thinking, economics and horse sense with your kids."
