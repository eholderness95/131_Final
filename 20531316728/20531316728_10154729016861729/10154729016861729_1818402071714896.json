        "message": "Facebook would sell your organs themselves if they could, they may have even asked their lawyers how/if they could work that into the user agreement for Facebook. So no, I don't see this as anything positive, when its done by a data-mining information-hungry piglet which forces us to give FB access to our phones, contacts, photos, and any info they could use to sell us to advertisers. Don't believe me?! notice the increasing ads on your feed? Ever notice someone who just got your number and isn't connected to you at all is suddenly recommended to be your friend? Slowly you'll realize, but it'd already too late. Just stop feeding the pig, or at least beware what you feed it."
