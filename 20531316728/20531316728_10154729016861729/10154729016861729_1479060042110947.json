I dont even want to writw the name but i would think you would know the big company. 3 times in 1 week i was made to change my password to get into facebook and messemger too. I wonder if anyone has such trouble? I've used computers since they came out. And its very user unfriendly. Its the times but what times. Everyone's hacking and the world has changed dramatically in the last 20 years. If you have password advice i dont know. I would appreciate if you did Tnanks"
