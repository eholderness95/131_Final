        "message": "I was asked at the DVR in Florida if I would like to become an organ donor.     I was so happy to have passed my test that i would have donated my whole body on the spot.   I inquired if, since I am 85, if they would want my poor old organs, and she said \"yes\" and I said \"yes\", so I am an organ donor.   Did not find out how this all takes place, but, will.   It certainly is a worthy cause."
