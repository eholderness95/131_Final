Facebook does not allow sharing a gofundme page to support those in need of assistance. I know because I have cerebral palsy and am trying to raise money for my cat's surgery. It seems I can't earn it or beg for it. I can't imagine if I ever needed a transplant. You should ask facebook to change policies regarding money assistance requests."
