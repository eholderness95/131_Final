        "message": "This brought a uplift to my day. I lost my 24 year old daughter two years ago on June 3, 2014. She became a donor after I explained to her what it meant at the age of 16 when getting her first drivers license. At the time of her passing she saved the lives of 5. Of those five I have been able to communicate with 3 this year. In 12 days we do a benefit in her memory and to bring awareness to the need for organ donation. I've tried to contact you without any luck to have you make a they memory DVD you offer. If you could please respond to me on that I would be grateful. Please continue to keep this vital message going here on Facebook."
