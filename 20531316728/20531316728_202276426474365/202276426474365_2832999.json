Is there anyway for members of groups to turn off the option to receive a noise on their phones  or email every time someone post in a particular group.  I am finding people are leaving groups because of this very reason.  The notifications have gotten crazy and you could see a huge drop soon if we aren't careful.  Thank you for your time."
