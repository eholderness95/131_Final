But don't know how to distinguish the selection for what is family and friends verses public. I don't want to have to make that distinction for everything I post. It would become very tedious for me to have to do that."

The audience selector tool remembers the audience you shared with the last time you posted something, and uses the same audience when you share again unless you change it. For example, if you choose Public for a post, your next post will also be Public unless you change the audience when you post. Learn more: https://www.facebook.com/help/120939471321735 -Sarah"
