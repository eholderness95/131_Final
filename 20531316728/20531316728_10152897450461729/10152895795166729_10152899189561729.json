I don't care how close a friend they are, or what group their in. I am constantly, shocked, disgusted and embarrassed for some people post, it's truly amazing! Potential employers look at fb, if I tend to look coo coo, I won't get the job. When I need a private, unsightly rant, I call a really close friend."
