He reposts this post along with a picture of his hot rod, which is nationally known, every few days making this false accusation along with other negative untrue comments and now tags a national car magazine that this person has ties to.  In my mind this is harassment. I've reported all these posts & Facebook didn't see a problem with it. I or this family have no way to make contact with them to even try to appeal to them to get these defamatory posts removed!!!"
