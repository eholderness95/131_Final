        "message": "I want to thank Facebook for its being available. For the past several years my husband was seriously ill and I was his care giver. It was difficult to get away from my home ... but then I didn't want to get away because I felt I needed to be at home. But despite having usually only a couple of brief times each week in the last two years in which I could physically mingle with others, I was given contact with the outside world daily primarily through Facebook. It became a Godsend to me, helping me mind, body, and soul and aiding me in keeping my commitment to my husband in a positive fashion. So thank you!"
