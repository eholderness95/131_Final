In the meantime, if your friend can't get into their account because it was taken over by someone else, please tell them to go to the Hacked Accounts section of the Help Center to get immediate help. Thanks! -Ryan"

I have no search field to search for other pages.  Basically my android phone will now only allow me to view or reply to notifications. I need access to my own home page, I need to make updates, I need to search, and I need to share... at least to my own homepage.  Also if I make any errors, it will no longer allow me to go in and edit my post from my phone.  "
