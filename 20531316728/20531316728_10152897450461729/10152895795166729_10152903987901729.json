Why if I want to install your facebook app on my phone do you have to have my acceptance to Device and app history, Identity, Contacts/Calendar, Location, SMS, Phone, Photos/Media/Files, Camera/Microphone, Wi-Fi connections, Device ID & Call Information and Other??? What exactly is other??? Why do you need all this just so I can use your app. This is an invasion of privacy! My microphone? Do you listen to people's conversations? I want to know why do you need all this information please! Please tell me. Thankyou!"
