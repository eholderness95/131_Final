        "message": "I wish you would go back to us only seeing what people share instead of seeing everything they like or comment on. And I hate seeing people's stuff I don't know. I hate checking Facebook for 2 hours! I can see something last week and because someone comments on it, it's on my feed again. Plus I like viewing the resent stuff, I can't keep it on that setting anymore. Everything is jumbled. And while I'm scrolling, Facebook refreshes on it's own. So I have to scroll way back down where I was. So frustrating. Please fix these things."
