Not that I have anything to hide. If it something I want to share with just one person then I message that person. Otherwise my life is open book can be check up on internet already. Will try not to offend any my fb friends and family. They don't have read every post, I'm sure that they don't and I won't post every little thing I do every second of the day. I do like some privacy. Enough said."
