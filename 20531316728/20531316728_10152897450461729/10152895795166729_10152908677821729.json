        "message": "The movie \"America\" is a must see.  You will learn so much about our country and the people who started it and the people who run it.  Where we came from and how others see us.  It is very well researched.  The good and the bad.  It is a true and entertaining way to get a refresher coarse on why we are the great nation we are and how important it is that we stay a leader in the world.  If you are between 18 and 40 it should be a requirement no matter your politics, race or religious persuasion.  GoGoGo Please"
