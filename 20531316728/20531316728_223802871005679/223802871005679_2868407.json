I really don't care which of my friends have been playing which games --  you already let me know that through the annoying and pointless blue box on the bottom right and all the spam notifications in my notifications list. Why did we need YET ANOTHER WAY TO DO THAT?!?  Plus it takes up WAY too much space and even messes with one of the games, FrontierVille, which plays in widescreen form."
