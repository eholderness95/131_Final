        "message": "YAY! Bravo! You guys are working hard at this company and it really gives me that feel of Apple Vs. Microsoft computing back in the beginning against IBM, but this is the future, a new generation with new products all working together. I think this is great. When you release info like this I feel it gets people excited; at least me anyway. I wonder if you have a FISH team? It seems like it would be a lot of fun working for the Facebook crew =D"
