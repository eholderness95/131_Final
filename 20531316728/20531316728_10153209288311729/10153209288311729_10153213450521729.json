        "message": "The \"say thanks\" videos are a great idea, but there's one problem. It only gives you certain pic from the persons profile and where it says \"add photo\" it goes to your files and it won't add them anyway. I wanted to make one for my daughter but the photos that it offers aren't the ones I want to use. How can that be changed, or can it be changed?"
