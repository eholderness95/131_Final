        "message": "Dear Facebook I'd like to know why my comments got deleted? Are you guys afraid that people would know that you deny to block fake profiles? Or is it because I said that actions you take seem to be stupid? It's over 30 reports now about 3 fake profiles with the same stolen pictures and you still saying that these profiles are not violating any rules or whatever. So what about safety of your users? How many times do I have to report these profiles for you to take any action? Or maybe you don't care if it's fake or not as long as it makes you rich?"
