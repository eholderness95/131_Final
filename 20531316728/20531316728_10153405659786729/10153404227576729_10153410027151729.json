I am sick and tired of their constant harassment, bullying, belittling, and no to ice the cake hacking my personal page while hiding behind a \"community\" page.  You people take down pages that have no reason to be taken down regularly, yet you refuse to do anything about someone who hacked my account and then posted my information.  I have the screenshot of that fake page posting my information that is only visible to friends."
