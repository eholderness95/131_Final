        "message": "Hey There!!! Facebook Administrators, I am seriously suggesting that FB really needs a User-Friendlly \"Alturnative\" within regards to the account recovery methods on this website. Besides what I'm trying to say today is Facebook should make a new feature that's capable of full surpassing the functionalities related to FB's \"Trusted Contacts\". In addition Facebook Administrators, I am continuing to suggest that FB needs to have further consideration about providing better services connected to account recovery methods. Lastly Facebook Administrators, I'm addtionally asking FB to sincerely consider my suggestion, I have stated today concerning a User-Friendly \"Alturnative\"."
