            "message": "Hi Bindaas. If you don't want to see a specific ad, you can click the x on the top right corner of the ad and choose hide. This will ensure that you no longer see this ad in your News Feed. We're striving to only show ads that are relevant and interesting to you. In addition, the News Feed algorithm responds to signals from you, including how often you interact with a friend, the number of likes, shares and comments a post receives, and how much you have interacted with this type of post in the past. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve your experience, please let us know at: http://on.fb.me/KNorNU -Hailey"
