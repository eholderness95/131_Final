            "message": "For about 10 minutes last night, the outside edges of the FB page turned blue, no matter if I refreshed or clicked on \"Tina\" or \"Home\"...  It was a bright sky/Microsoft blue.  Lighter than the FB blue.  If CSS is used in these pages, then I would say this was the { background color: xxx } line in the CSS page.  If it's DHTML, it was probably somewhere in the master < body > tag.  I'd ask your webmaster if anyone was attempting to use a test color in order to identify a tag in CSS or DHTML (or possibly JavaScript) for some testing purpose.  That's the best advice I can offer up.  Anyway, in general, everything that \"floats\" on top (or is otherwise boxed over to one side or the other) was the normal white or gray, but the background turned blue."
