        "message": "You blocked me and asked me to let you know if this was a mistake. The first time I replied by asking 'why\" and told you this was a mistake. But obviously I will not get a reply just as on other blocking occassions so I will answer for myself. You blocked me this time for three weeks because you don't like my political views and you have the power to censor people with views like mine and you take advantage of your power to censor, and you use it. Why else would you block me for three weeks? This is unAmerican but you don't care. If I posted things you like, then I would never get blocked. Facebook you are a bully, and worse, you are the kind of people that Americans fight against and die to protect their liberty. Naturally you won't respond to this which only further proves what I say is correct. Shame on you!"
