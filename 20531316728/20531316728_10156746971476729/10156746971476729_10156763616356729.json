She has violated the group rules and has been removed and blocked, but I can't even tell her that.\n\nYou have been removed from and blocked from Resources for posting the advertising for digitizing services. This is a blatant violation of the group rules you should have read before applying to join. You will not be allowed back in the group without contacting the owner, Lenora Porzillo, after two weeks."
