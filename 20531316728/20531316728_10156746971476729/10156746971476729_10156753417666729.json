I hide them, and boom, they are back the next day.  I miss the old days when their was  freedom of ideas and thoughts.  I guess those days are gone."

I'm  a moderator on several groups and with this lockout, I can only do approvals for those that want to join the groups. I can't send messages to those that want to join but didn't bother to answer the questions they must answer to become members. You know what that means. it means there are others that are going to have to send those messages and they risk being locked out of sending because you're going to decide they are sending too many messages and call it spam, once again without looking into the reasons or communicating with the people that find themselves in the same predicament that I am now in. Lift the lockout so I can get back to business."
