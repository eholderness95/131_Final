        "message": "Facebook blocked my MAIN account and demanded a photo of my ID to verify my name. 26 days since I keep sending in my ID and my other documents, but Facebook is not checking it, not verifying my name and I'm still locked out. No moderator/admin ever contact me, I don't even get automatized robot replies from Facebook.\nI post about the problem in the Facebook Community help, those posts are also getting ignored. Just like these I post here.\nWhy did Facebook demanded my government/state issued ID card from me, if they won't check it to verify my name and unlock my account? Why did my account got locked at the first place? When do I get my account back?"
