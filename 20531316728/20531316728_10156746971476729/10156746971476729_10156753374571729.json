But there is one thing I have hoped for since I started using FB...\n\nCan you make it so I can hide all posts on a topic? For example, just being current, I wish to hide all post that contain \"Al Franken\" don't care who/where/when they were posted. Would love to do that. Would love the option, \"forever, or past 30 days\".  Forever would be used to never to see the word \"Kardashian\" on my wall/home/trending ever again."
