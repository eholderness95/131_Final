        "message": "Dear Facebook:   Your \"flash ads\" are annoying and could cause epileptic fits or migraines...in those so inclined.  I suggest you cease and desist, especially IF these are ads I have already asked that I permanently did not want to see.  IF they are \"just ads\".... then you especially need to cease and desist, since subliminal advertising is (in my humble opinion) akin to water boarding....\nLaws. The United States does not have a specific federal or state law addressing the use of subliminal messages in advertising. Instead, it is the country's advertising and broadcasting regulatory agencies that deal with the topic and its impact on the public."
