        "message": "ONCE AGAIN Facebook has screwed me over on my account and there is no way to stop them. Two of their employees said they would help me and did nothing and now two months later the same issues. My billing is so screwed up and they keep charging me before my billing date  and changing my billing date. In doing that  they are taking money I need to survive and run my business.. How can you constantly change billing dates as I have photoshopped them to prove what they did. Thus is a horrible company and they blocked me on Facebook Business after I complained there so people will think they are getting all positive reviews."
