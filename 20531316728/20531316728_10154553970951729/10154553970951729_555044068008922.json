Also, those awful so called pictures that are really just cute sayings people keep putting up... It would be nice if either FB could read out the words, or else indicate that it is a picture of words.  That way I wouldn't have to keep getting family to look at the picture, only to find that it is a silly saying in picture format.  What a waste of time.  Can't wait to see how far this goes.  Would be wonderful if only... <sigh>"
