        "message": "I HATE the new changes to \"Edit Friends\".\n\n1) When viewing any list I cannot see which lists, and how many lists a person is in without pointing on each profile \"Edit Lists\". Total waist of time. \n\n2) \"Recently Added\" list does not work, it shows the \"Recents\" or \"All Friends\", not the \"Recently Added\". \n\n3) I cannot view all \"Contacts\" as before which would let me see my \"Awaiting friend confirmation\"."
