        "message": "Can fb explain why this is happening on alot of fb accounts? Can you please fix it so it doesn't happen? There are many people that have a certain amount of friends at one second and without adding or deleting friends...simply refreshing the page, 10-15 or more \"friends\" appear in the friend list count. I call this an invasion of privacy and want fb to do something about it. I don't want this happening on my fb account and I want to know why it's happening.\nhttp://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=1642480862862"
