At the same time Facebook send me E-MAIL messages that my account will be deleted if I do not update my page!!\n\nIt is a Catch22 I cannot login and update my account,, but at the same time you want me to login and update my page. I have this brand name account on various other social media platforms Google+, YouTube, Twitter, Tumblr and none of them has any problems or complaints. I have a website that I had links to from Facebook, I have hundreds of friends on Facebook with whom I cannot communicate. I spent a lot of time trying to comply with Facebook requests for identification yet, they are ignored. I am considering to write and article for the media to describe how hypocritical policies of Facebook and how they are poorly managed and enforced. I hope you will help me to resolve my problem. Please, respond to this account e-mail and I will provide more details."
