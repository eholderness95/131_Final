You can adjust what you see in your News Feed by hiding stories you don't want to see, by following or unfollowing friends, by choosing to see fewer stories from certain friends and by using \u201cSee First\u201d. Learn how at: http://bit.ly/2r7qEvI. We've also found that many people have a better experience when they can tell us what they'd like to see. If there is something we can do to improve your News Feed experience, please let us know at: http://bit.ly/2qC6TsC. -William"
