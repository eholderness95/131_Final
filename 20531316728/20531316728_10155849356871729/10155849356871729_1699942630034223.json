        "message": "I have an individual that reviewed our Society's page in February of 2014. Giving us a low rating (*2), I contacted this individual on more than one occasion to ask for reasons he rated us so low. This is the last message in April of this year; \n\n\"It has been more than two years since I asked what we could do to improve upon our page to improve your lone poor rating. I am requesting you justify your rating, or remove it altogether, please! I would appreciate your comments..\"\n\nHe is not a follower nor a friend on the page, and will not answer any communication. What can I do to relieve this unfair review?\nThere is another issue I would also like to discuss about this, but would prefer to do this offline or PM. Thank you."
