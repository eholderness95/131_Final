        "message": "Please fix your News Feed defaults, or at least allow me to fix mine without having to change it every time I get on.  I, like a lot of people I know, want the posts in News Feed to default to Most Recent.  Also, when I set it to most recent, do not filter any of my friends posts.  When I get on Facebook, I would like to be able to scroll to the last time I was on, and have all of my friends posts pop up.  That way, I know I haven't missed anything or offended anybody because I didn't respond to a post that I never saw.  As it is right now, if I leave the setting on Top Stories, I keep getting the same stories rehashed.  When I set it to Most Recent, I only see some of the posts.  I know this is true, because I've had posts that say they were, for instance, posted 10 minutes ago, yet when I change the setting to Most Recent, the post is not there where it should be.  What makes you think you would know what my Top Stories are, anyway?  Are you psychic?  PLEASE FIX THIS!!!"
