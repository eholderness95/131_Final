It is against Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities to maintain more than one personal account and this could be the reason your accounts were disabled.

Because my only account has been blocked to expire my session instantly and demand a phone# but never permit me to enter one, all because I complained about prior blocking that was \"temporary\"\n\nIt feels like this is deliberate from facebook to ensure I have zero active accounts not \"one\". There is no possible feedback, no possible email, NOTHING. Fully locked out from anything."
