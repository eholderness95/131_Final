You can then request to claim the Pages and become the admin, or merge the Page into a Page you already manage for your business: http://bit.ly/2rwftgw. However, if the Page is managed, you won't see the option to claim it. If this is the case, you can report the Page: http://bit.ly/2rgz7Na. Please keep in mind that we are not able to provide support for Page disputes between third parties. -Jessica"
