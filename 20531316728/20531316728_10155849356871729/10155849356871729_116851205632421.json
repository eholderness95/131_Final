        "message": "Hello, I wrote to the Help Center two weeks / from 18.7.2017 / and no answer. \nI wrote about 20 messages and no reply to the party! I have been attacked and misused my advertising account. On my account someone has launched an ad!!! , because facebook does not answer my report! It is very stressful and I can not work. How can I solve the problem ?! When I do not want to pay, I had to block all credit cards so that facebook does not take me out of the amount that the fraudster in my ad account has missed! Can you please step on the steps to continue and what do I do next? well thank you. At this time, my account was unlawfully attacked by a fraudster and misused my account for his ad."

If you believe that there has been fraudulent activity on your ad account, review your purchase history to make sure you're aware of all the purchases made on your ad account. If you see purchases that you don't recognize and believe someone else made them who shouldn't have access to your ad account, please submit a report to our ads team here: http://bit.ly/2vIqmPA. -Ashley"
