I spent 21 frustrating minutes trying to figure out how to change the Facebook font to be helvetica but Facebook wants to ruin everyone's lives by choosing the font for us... I don't want this font. Also I want the text window to be a circle but it's a square. Facebook can u fix these problems? It's a big problem."
