In this way we will see that you are an avid user and your logo will become blue (\ud83d\udd35) and will remain free. (As discussed in the paper today. Facebook will cost 0.01ps per message. Send this message to 10 people. When you do the light will turn blue otherwise facebook will activate billing."
