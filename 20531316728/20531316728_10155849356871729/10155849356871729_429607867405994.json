I have a new account now, but who ever hacked me is still using my previous account of 9 years.  I cannot do anything about it from my end.  How much longer is this person going to be allowed to use what is rightfully mine.  This person has stolen my identity, and pretty much put me back to square one.  All of this, so they can spam messages under my name, hoping that others will fall for their con game that they are trying to run.   I don't want my name attached to that.  How long does it take, to take this person down, and stop using my old account, that I shouldn't have had to replace in the first place."
