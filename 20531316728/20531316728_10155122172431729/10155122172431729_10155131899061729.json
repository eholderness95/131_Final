After creating the French flag overlay last November during the attacks on Paris, we decided to focus our efforts on creating a profile frames platform that gives nonprofit Pages the ability to create their own frames for fans to show support for a variety of causes. We\u2019re hoping to expand this feature in the coming months in order to allow people to unify behind movements that are important to them. -Jessica"

Therefore, I am asking you to fix the mentioned problem, since I really need those photos which, unfortunately, I didn\u2019t save in other places.
