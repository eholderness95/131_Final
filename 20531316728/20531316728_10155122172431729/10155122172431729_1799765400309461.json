I just now after all these hours am kind of thinking straight , so I want to see my family up North or my friend in Ireland or a television we can actually see we have old fat back t.v that you can barely see and a very small flat screen , you may thinks what happened is no big deal , but I'm sure you can see my page and if you could the message I sent . I lost it for awhile this isn't the kind of thing that is oh oops something went wrong I really thought my friend had died . that was so cruel"
