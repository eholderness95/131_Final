        "message": "Hi Facebook. I don't usually like to complain but if you continue to block the messaging function on your mobile web app I think I will deactivate my account. I don't want to use a separate app to message my Facebook friends. I already stopped using the Facebook iOS app because you blocked the messaging functionality on that app. Maybe this will be a good excuse to reclaim all the excess time I sink into social media. Just my two cents!"
