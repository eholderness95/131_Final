I'm not that knowlegable about fb pages so it was only recently I noticed people could 'score' you on the page. My first score was one measly star by someone who was not a client. Her aunt approached me to press her neice's wedding bouquet. A pink affair where, in my job thats a colour that alters hugely. I advised aunt. She gave me the go ahead on a particular shade (I touch up pinks). When it was collected the neice said it was a disaster. I offered to alter the colour at no cost. Not that I had any obligation to since I had faithfully followed the aunts instructions. Neice left premises saying she wasnt interested in alteration. Then I see the nasty one star. I love my work and work hard to maintain a high level of client satisfaction. T"
