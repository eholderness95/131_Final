If an email or Facebook message looks strange, don't click any of the links or open any attachments and report it to us by following these steps: http://bit.ly/2efSMpZ. Keep in mind that Facebook will never ask you for your password in an email or send it to you as an attachment. -Joe"

Facebook's inaction has been screwing over a friend of mine for months and showing Facebook's complete lack of care. They were PHYSICALLY hacked and their VERIFIED PAGE was transferred away by someone making themselves and Admin and then waiting a week to delete her account as admin of that Verified page. Your system does not account for that and I'm seeing it happen to other people now too. Your phone is sitting here, I grab it, I do that, I leave, you have no idea it's happened. I delete you from admin of your verified page. that's how it works. I need you to contact me for the details or look at anything i've submitted the last 7 months trying to get your attention."
