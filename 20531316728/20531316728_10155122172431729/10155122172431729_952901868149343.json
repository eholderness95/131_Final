If your friend can't get into their account because it was taken over by someone else, please tell them to go to the Hacked Accounts section at http://bit.ly/2fVcPMx to get immediate help. You can also encourage them to visit Privacy Basics at http://bit.ly/2fN0qLf for tips and guides to help them keep their account secure. -Joe"
