        "message": "Hi, I have a group for medical support on Facebook. All of a sudden now we cannot open up our files to read. And we cannot remove them either. --The ones with \"Show History\" to thre right of the title will open but the other ones will not. How do we delete the ones that will not open? Thank you for your help. This was very upsetting as I have spent many many hours on research for our medical group and now cannot open any of our Education Files. !!!!!"
