        "message": "Thank God for Facebook. Thank God for Mr. MS for creating FB and made it available for everyone to use. Before, phone was the best way to reach out and touch someone. Now it's FB. Not just to communicate to one person, but to reach out to countless people simultaneously.  Somehow, people who have no one to talk to before can just go to FB and can make friends. If, and when used properly, FB is one of the best ways to pass the time profitably. Congratulations FB. Congratulations Mr. MS. God bless you."
