        "message": "Hello Coke, \n\nI really enjoy your products but I am very upset to hear that Coca-Cola does not use 100% recyclable plastic bottles. Plastic that ends up in our oceans and in landfill. That is out of order.\n\nPlease can you explain to me why Coca-Cola is not putting the future of our children's planet before profits? Surly a company the size of yours can be doing more?\n\nUntil I hear that you are I will not be purchasing any of your products.\nAlso I will be telling all my friends to stop buying your products.\n\nRegards,"
