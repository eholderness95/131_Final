        "message": "Dear Coke, I would like to remind you about the place Plachimada in Kerala. Your company used to have a plant there and used to drain litres of water every day. After it affected the groundwater level in the area people organised epic protest campaign against your plant. While you sell beverages and water, you are essentially impacting the water resources of this country. In wake of this severe draught, it will be a nice gesture from your part to make up for the mistakes your company in India ,if you provide potable water to draught hit areas . Rather than wasting crores on silly ads you could easily provide support to people in drought hit areas . You can get more goodwill from customers and non-customers. Some times a bottle of water can be priceless. Regards"
