We appreciate your responses and gradual shift towards full responsibility for your plastics and eventual replacement with better materials.However they tend to ignore the significant amount of leakage that occurs with Coca Cola plastic bottles due to a whole host of reasons. The results of the shift to plastics from the late seventies onwards are here. This leakage is happening on a  daily basis around the world. What more can you do right now? For example, are you trialling bio-benign materials yet? An incredible brand needs incredible vision."
