            "message": "Hi Evelyn, thanks for getting in touch. We\u2019re proud to say that all of our bottles and cans in Great Britain are 100% recyclable and have been since 2012. This means that all our drinks packaging can be recycled at home or when you\u2019re out and about.   We know sustainability, and recycling specifically, is a vital issue to address and that\u2019s why we\u2019re currently in the process of reviewing our sustainable packaging strategy which we will publish in the summer. To keep up to date, please head to: www.coca-cola.co.uk/sustainability-section"
