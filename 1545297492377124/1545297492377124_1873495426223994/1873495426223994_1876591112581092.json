            "message": "Hi Celia, we know sustainability, and recycling specifically, is a vital issue to address and that\u2019s why we\u2019re currently in the process of reviewing our sustainable packaging strategy which we will publish in the summer. Deposit return schemes have been a big part of these discussions as more people are looking for ways to increase recycling rates. So while our review is still ongoing, it\u2019s clear to us that the time is right to trial a well-designed deposit scheme for drinks containers, starting in Scotland where conversations are underway already. To keep up to date with all of our future sustainability announcements please visit www.coca-cola.co.uk/sustainability-section"
