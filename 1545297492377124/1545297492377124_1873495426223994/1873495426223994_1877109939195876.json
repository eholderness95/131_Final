            "message": "Hi Doreen, thanks for getting in touch. We\u2019re proud to say that all of our bottles and cans in Great Britain are 100% recyclable and have been since 2012. This means that all our drinks packaging can be recycled at home or when you\u2019re out and about. However, we understand there is always more that can be done and we\u2019ve embarked on a major review of our sustainable packaging strategy.  To keep up to date with all of our future sustainability announcements please visit www.coca-cola.co.uk/sustainability-section"
