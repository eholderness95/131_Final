            "message": "Hi John, thanks for getting in touch. We have a new plan to see all of our packaging recovered so that none ends up where it shouldn\u2019t. The first step is to double the amount of recycled plastic in our bottles to 50% by 2020. We\u2019ll also launch our biggest ever ad campaign to inspire more of our consumers to recycle and champion new ways to improve packaging recovery.
