Deposit return schemes are also a big part of these discussions as more people are looking for ways to increase recycling rates. So while our review is still ongoing, it\u2019s clear to us that the time is right to trial a well-designed deposit scheme for drinks containers, starting in Scotland where conversations are underway already. To keep up to date, please head to: www.coca-cola.co.uk/sustainability-section"
