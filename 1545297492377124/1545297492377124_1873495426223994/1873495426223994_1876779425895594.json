The first fully recyclable plastic bottle made partly with a special plastic which comes from plant material, which means we don\u2019t have to use as much petroleum-based plastic. \n\nWe have embarked on a major review of our sustainable packaging strategy.

So while our review is still ongoing, it\u2019s clear to us that the time is right to trial a well-designed deposit scheme for drinks containers, starting in Scotland where conversations are underway already.
