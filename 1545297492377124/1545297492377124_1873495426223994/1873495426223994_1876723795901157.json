            "message": "Hi David, thanks for getting in touch. We\u2019ve already been using renewable packaging innovations for many years, like the PlantBottle. The first fully recyclable plastic bottle made partly with a special plastic which comes from plant material, which means we don\u2019t have to use as much petroleum-based plastic. \n\nWe\u2019re also proud to say that all of our bottles and cans in Great Britain are 100% recyclable and have been since 2012. This means that all our drinks packaging can be recycled at home or when you\u2019re out and about.  We have embarked on a major review of our sustainable packaging strategy to understand what role we can play to unlock the full potential of a circular economy.  To keep up to date with all of our future sustainability announcements please visit www.coca-cola.co.uk/sustainability-section"

            "message": "hi coke- how long would your PlantBottle have sat in my local street unless i'd picked the damn thing up and binned it myself. Single use bottles are the problem - they have no value and too many of your delightful customers think its acceptable to chuck them wherever they like once they have drunk the contents - Oceans, lakes, rivers, my walk to school absolutely EVERYWHERE and YOU should be paying for the clean up....."
