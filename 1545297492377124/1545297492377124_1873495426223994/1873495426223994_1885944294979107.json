        "message": "nearly 2,000 plastic pellets that are melted to make things like plastic bottles inside a plastic coca-cola bottle all found on Porthtowan beach. Created by Georgina Maxwell in collaboration with SAS (Surfers Against Sewage). Check out two artworks made from Coca-Cola bottle tops alone sourced from Cornwall coastline and S. France , the Med coastline. Pics don't want to upload here so check out my website on www.georginamaxwell.org .. I am a contemporary marine eco-artist responding to the suffering of marine life due to plastic pollution."
