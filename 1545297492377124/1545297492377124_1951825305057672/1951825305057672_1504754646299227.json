        "message": "I hate the jingle at the end of the advert now it\u2019s just ruined a lot of Christmas memories for me especially. I can\u2019t recall the Santa winking but with this many people commenting on it surely it actually happened not this many people can be wrong. Coca Cola you have spoiled a great Christmas advert there was nothing wrong with it the way it was. I vote that you change it back to the way it was if your brave enough why don\u2019t you open a poll and let the people vote and if there\u2019s enough votes you change it back????"
