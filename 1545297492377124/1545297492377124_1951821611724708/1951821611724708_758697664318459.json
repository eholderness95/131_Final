        "message": "Makes me cry every year. First time I saw it was early 1990\u2019s. \nI remember watching it with my grandad, on Xmas eve. I used to spend every Xmas with him and my Nan. They made everything about Christmas magical to me as a child. As soon as my stepdad came along, all the magic went away. \n\nThey are bittersweet tears. Happy because of the memories. \nSad because he\u2019s not here and I so badly wish he was, I need him so much.\n\nBut thank you for the happy memories each year xxx"
