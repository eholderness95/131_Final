        "message": "What on earth have you done to the zero sugar coca cola ? I bought 10 cans and couldn't work out why it tasted so different then realized It says new and improved taste on the can, well sorry but it tastes horrible like the cheap cola you get in the supermarkets , I am now going to have to palm it off to whoever will take it . Had  to go out again and buy some normal diet cola ... please if it aint broke don't fix it , it was fine as it was , I won't be buying it anymore you can keep your new and improved stuff it isn't nice at all :("
