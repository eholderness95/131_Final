            "message": "Hi Eleanor, thanks for getting in touch. We know sustainability, and recycling specifically, is a vital issue to address and that\u2019s why we\u2019re currently in the process of reviewing our sustainable packaging strategy which we\u2019ll publish later in the year.  Deposit return schemes are also a big part of these discussions as more people are looking for ways to increase recycling rates and conversations are already underway in Scotland.
