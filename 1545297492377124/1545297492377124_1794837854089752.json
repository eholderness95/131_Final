        "message": "Coca Cola,\n\nTwo weeks ago I went to my local supermarket and bought two bottles of Coca Cola. One was cherry coke and the other was regular coke. I got home and opened the first bottle - flat! I threw it away and opened the second bottle - flat! Literally money down the drain.\n\nFast forward a few weeks to today, in the same supermarket, bottles of Coca Cola were on offer, 2 for \u00a32. So I bought four bottles. 2 X cherry coke, 2 X regular Coke. Got home and opened one bottle of regular Coke - flat again! All four bottles were flat!!\n\nEach time this has occurred I have checked to dates and all were inside their BBE dates.\n\nSo now I've wasted a fair bit of money for non consumable goods. And since the #holidaysarecoming, I'm reluctant to stock up over the festive season. A shame really as I really don't like Pepsi!"
