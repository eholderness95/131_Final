            "message": "Hi  Artur, thanks for getting in touch. Sustainability is an important issue and one that we care about deeply as a company. We\u2019d hate to see any of our bottles or cans ending up where they shouldn\u2019t and want as many of them as possible to be recycled so that we can use them to make into new bottles and cans again.\n\nAll of our bottles and cans in Great Britain are 100% recyclable and can be recycled at home or when you\u2019re out and about.  We also want to make sure we use the least amount of plastic, aluminium or glass in each container and that as much recycled material as possible makes into new cans and bottles.  At the moment, at least 25% of the material in all of our bottles is recycled plastic, our aluminium cans contain around 42% recycled aluminium and there\u2019s 47% recycled glass in our glass bottles. And we want to go further: we\u2019re  committed to increasing the amount of recycled and renewable material in our plastic bottles from 25% to 40% by 2020. \n\nAdditionally, we\u2019re currently reviewing our sustainable packaging strategy which we\u2019ll publish in the summer. Deposit return schemes have been a big part of these discussions as more people are looking for ways to increase recycling rates. So while our review is still ongoing, it\u2019s clear to us that the time is right to trial a well-designed deposit scheme for drinks containers, starting in Scotland where conversations are underway already. \n\nIt\u2019s a very complex problem, but we\u2019re committed to finding new ways to minimise materials we use and help reduce waste.

            "message": "Coca Cola- that still doesn't answer the fact that you are producing 100 billion plastic bottles per year! \nSurely there an alternative greener plastic that Coca Cola could research into? I read there is a plant based plastic bottle you you are considering. \nAs much as Coca Cola is trying to be green you are not facing the reality of the damage and harm your plastic bottles globally are creating. \nAdditionally a plastic bottle takes time to decay and once ingested by a creature ...it will take a long time to decay and by that time will have killed those creatures.\n\nA full and responsible solution must be found and it can only happen with the passion and accountability to effect change! \n\nCoca Cola is a great brand but PLEASE let's make a real change for the benefit of our beautiful planet\ud83d\udc9a"
