        "message": "Dear Coke :\nIndia is facing a drinking water disaster as the current summer is the hottest on record and millions are without water.\nYou need to drop the price of your Mineral water bottles in India. Rupees TWO  a bottle for the next 9 weeks (until the end of june) will be a fair price (covers your costs). This price drop will help millions of children and help to mitigate the disaster.\nPlease listen to this request. And revert with a public advertisement in India newspapers. As a RESPONSIBLE CORPORATE CITIZEN."
