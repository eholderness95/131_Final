        "message": "Dear Mr C Cola,\nI'll smile just a soon as you start using silver lids for your Diet Coke bottles again. Being the proprietor of a thriving mobile bar company, regularly stocking both regular and Diet Coke, amongst various other less-relevant-to-this-diatribe options, I can't begin to express what a royal pain in the proverbial it is guessing my way around a stocktake whilst viewing these bottles in a crate from above. \nFailing the return to silver, I insist you instead replace the regular Coke lids with rainbow colours, because, you know, everyone likes a freaking rainbow!\nI anticipate your favourable response.\nForever yours,\nLuke x"

The new design gives our bottles and cans a more consistent look and feel, and makes it easier for you to see the choices available. You can find out more here: http://spr.ly/6189860Rt. Thanks"
