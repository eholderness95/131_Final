            "message": "Hi Michael, We\u2019re working hard to ensure that our packaging is as sustainable as possible. Plastic has lots of benefits and is fully recyclable. It\u2019s much lighter and uses less material than glass. It also can\u2019t get broken easily so it\u2019s safer. As long as it\u2019s responsibly disposed of, it can be recycled and reused into other packaging or fibre. We also believe supporting the introduction of la well \u2013designed deposit returns scheme may help improve recycling rates. Ultimately that decision must be led by Government but requiring many organisations, \u2013 public and private \u2013 to work in partnership. In our strategy for Great Britain, we\u2019ve focused on the actions we think will make the biggest impact in a near future. Learn more here: http://spr.ly/61898QFsJ"
