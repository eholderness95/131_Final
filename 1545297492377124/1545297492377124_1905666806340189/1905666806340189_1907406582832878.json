We believe supporting the introduction of a well \u2013designed deposit returns scheme in Scotland may help improve recycling rates. However, as the introduction of a full deposit returns scheme is a complex process and takes time, rather than wait, we want to test and understand how a small financial incentive can change peoples\u2019 behaviour and what impact it can have on littering and recycling of soft drinks packaging."
