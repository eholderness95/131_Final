        "message": "Hi Coca Cola! What about the plastic in the ocean? This would represent a benefit for the ecosystem and assure you more material for recycled bottles. Are your plastic bottles just yours? Who owns the pet after it's used? I mean you can't recycle other brands? I live in the U.K. But I'm from Mexico and Coca-Cola has made many things about recycling pet including converting into textile, art etc, I am interested into textiles made with pet, who I can contact about this?"
