Ultimately that decision must be led by Government but requiring many organisations, \u2013 public and private \u2013 to work in partnership. We\u2019ve been working with stakeholders in Scotland to understand the best approach to DRS for some time and want any planned DRS to be well-designed, making sure it has the biggest impact on litter and the lowest impact on your regular household collection."
