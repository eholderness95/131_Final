You made a statement saying you wouldn't use recycled materials unless the government enforce it. You should be doing this as a statement to show you want to better the world, not your bank balance. \nDon't you think your company has done enough to destroy the planet for financial gain"

This is why as part of our strategy we will be seeking reform of the recycling system in the UK to improve recovery and recycling rates."
