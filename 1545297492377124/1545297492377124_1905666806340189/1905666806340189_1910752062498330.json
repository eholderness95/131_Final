        "message": "Please Coca-Cola... Consider having a bottle re-use scheme, where bottles are washed and reused. Recycling is RUBBISH, it is extremely costly and most of the time people don't recycle them. A reuse scheme could encourage people to trade their bottles in for cash and reduce the impact that coca-cola have on the planet drastically. It would be wonderful if you could lead the re-use revolution!"
