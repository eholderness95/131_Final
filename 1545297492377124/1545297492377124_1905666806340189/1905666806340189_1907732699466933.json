Import recycled plastics or make all your bottles out of plants for all your portfolio. Manufacturers must be held accountable for what they create and stop making excuses. If you find people are not recycling bring in an incentive for everyone who takes bottles to be recycled. Instigate the scheme you say you will support like in the German market. You have enough capital and buying power to make these things happen"
