However, we\u2019re working hard to ensure our packaging is as sustainable as possible. When plastic packaging is responsibly disposed of, it can be recycled and used again and again. Currently we use 25% recycled plastic and have committed to doubling the amount to 50% by 2020. We\u2019d like to use more but there\u2019s not enough recycled plastic in the UK at the moment, we need more bottles to be recycled. This is why as part of our strategy we will be seeking reform of the recycling system in the UK to improve recovery and recycling rates. We\u2019ve also been researching and creating alternatives to oil based plastics, such as our PlantBottle\u2122, which is the first-ever recyclable plastic bottle made from plants. We use the PlantBottle for all of our Honest Tea and Smartwater range here in Great Britain and are always looking at ways that we can expand its use across our portfolio."

What efforts Coca-Cola, exactly, will you make to massively minimising (on an enormous scale) your non recycled waste? Will you be putting it to the government to start a bottle deposit scheme? As it has proved very successful in germany. Will you be funding ocean clean ups? Also, away from the UK, as Coca-Cola is a world wide organisation, what precautions will be made globally? Including third world countries where coke is also sold. This is a world wide issue afterall."
