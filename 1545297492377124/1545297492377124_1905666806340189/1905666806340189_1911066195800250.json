            "message": "Hi Ben, we\u2019re working hard to ensure our packaging is as sustainable as possible. Plastic has lots of benefits and is fully recyclable. It\u2019s much lighter and uses less material than glass. It also can\u2019t get broken easily so it\u2019s safer. As long as it\u2019s responsibly disposed of, it can be recycled and reused into other packaging or fibre. we\u2019ve also been researching and creating alternatives to oil based plastics, such as our PlantBottle\u2122, which is the first-ever recyclable plastic bottle made from plants. We use the PlantBottle for all of our Honest Tea and Smartwater range here in Great Britain and are always looking at ways that we can expand its use across our portfolio."
