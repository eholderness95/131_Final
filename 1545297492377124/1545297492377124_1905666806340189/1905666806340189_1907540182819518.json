        "message": "I really wish you'd do like the old school pop man used to, glass bottles that they would collect wash and reuse. Even if you had to drop them off at the supermarket or something! The other thing id love is if you had refillable packs... like boxes of wine but Diet Coke. Or you take a vessel to the shop and refill it from Coke taps. That way I'd still get to drink Diet Coke, you get to sell it and we're both being sustainable and using less plastic. These ideas probably wouldn't work in reality but I can dream! I wonder if McDonald's or subway would let me refill my empty 2 litre bottles \ud83e\udd14"

            "message": "Hi Molly, in the UK, the industry and retailers stopped using refillable packaging many years ago partly because of the space and complexity required to manage this type of system. They will always remain an option for future sustainable packaging. However, it\u2019s a change that would require a significant reinvestment and a change along the whole supply chain in the UK. In our strategy for Great Britain, we\u2019ve focused on the actions we think will make the biggest impact in a near future. We believe supporting the introduction of a well \u2013designed deposit returns scheme in Scotland may help improve recycling rates."
