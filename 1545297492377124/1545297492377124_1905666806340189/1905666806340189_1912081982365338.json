We understand that it\u2019s hard to like plastic right now but it does play an essential role in providing food and drink that is clean, safe, convenient and fresh. Plastic packaging is much lighter, has lower carbon impact, uses less energy to manufacture than glass and is fully recyclable. As long as it\u2019s responsibly disposed of, it can be recycled and reused into new packaging or other uses such as fibres and fabric. Recycled plastic also uses around two-thirds less energy than virgin plastic, so as recovery rates and technology improve, plastic will become more sustainable."

As part of our strategy, we will be seeking reform of the recycling system in the UK to improve recovery and recycling rates. We are continually evolving our recycling strategy and investing in innovations to support our overall sustainability commitments."
