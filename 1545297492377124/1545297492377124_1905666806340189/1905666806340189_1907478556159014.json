But kind of useless given for the last week or so you\u2019ve been giving out mini cans of Coke Zero across Bristol centre and it seems hardly any of the cans are ending up in bins. They\u2019re everywhere. Perhaps you could send your reps out with recycling bins to encourage people to put the cans in after drinking rather than just letting people make a mess of the streets. \ud83d\ude13"

I'm looking forward to hearing about the results of your \"investigation\", feel free to update Anthony Helen and myself whenever you like. Also to expand on your sustainability policies why not try infinitely recyclable, rather than a measly 100% recyclable. There's this incredible new material called glass. It seems to do well for you in central Europe and elsewhere. I suggest you try it in the UK, and USA, I think it might take on. It's sexier, more tactile, more luxurious and infinitely recyclable without loss of quality or robustness. It could really improve your brand. Regards, Callum."
