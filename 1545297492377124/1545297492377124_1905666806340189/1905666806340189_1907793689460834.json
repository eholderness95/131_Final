            "message": "Hi Gareth, in the UK, the industry and retailers stopped using refillable packaging many years ago partly because of the space and complexity required to manage this type of system. They will always remain an option for future sustainable packaging. However, it\u2019s a change that would require a significant reinvestment and a change along the whole supply chain in the UK. In our strategy for Great Britain, we\u2019ve focused on the actions we think will make the biggest impact in a near future."
