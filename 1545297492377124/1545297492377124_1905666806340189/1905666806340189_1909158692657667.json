We\u2019ll be working with a number of different partners, including Wrap, Keep Britain Tidy, as well as our customers and the Government to continue looking into making it easier to for packaging to be recovered and recycled. We\u2019ll also continue to encourage Government reform of the current producer responsibility system here in Great Britain. Alongside this to increase packaging recovery, we\u2019re also looking into how a well-designed deposit return scheme (DRS) could work in Great Britain."
