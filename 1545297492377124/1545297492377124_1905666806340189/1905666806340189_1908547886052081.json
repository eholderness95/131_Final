As one of the biggest drinks brands in the world, you have a responsibility to be doing more to help save the planet and to protect wild life."

It is true that we\u2019ve expressed concerns about deposit return schemes in the past. Whilst some concerns remain, what\u2019s clear is that recycling rates have stalled and there\u2019s a need to address the issue of recycling and on-the-go littering and we believe we should try something different. We\u2019re looking into how a well-designed deposit return scheme (DRS) could work in Great Britain and have been working with stakeholders in Scotland to understand the best approach."
