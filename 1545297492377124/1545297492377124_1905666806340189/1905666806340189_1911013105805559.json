            "message": "Hi Ashleigh, in the UK, the industry and retailers stopped using refillable packaging many years ago partly because of the space and complexity required to manage this type of system. They will always remain an option for future sustainable packaging. However, it\u2019s a change that would require a significant reinvestment and a change along the whole supply chain in the UK. In our strategy for Great Britain, we\u2019ve focused on the actions we think will make the biggest impact in a near future. Plastic has lots of benefits and is fully recyclable. It\u2019s much lighter and uses less material than glass. It also can\u2019t get broken easily so it\u2019s safer. As long as it\u2019s responsibly disposed of, it can be recycled and reused into other packaging or fibre. As part of our strategy, we will be seeking reform of the recycling system in the UK to improve recovery and recycling rates."
