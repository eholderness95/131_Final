        "message": "You've been fighting bottle deposit schemes in the UK for some time now. \nI've signed a number of petitions to get your company on board with these.\nRegardless of whether your bottles are 100% recyclable or not, the plastics you source mostly haven't been reused. \nI've heard this is because Coke wants it's bottles to look 'clear' and can't get this look from 100% recycled material. This is disgustingly wasteful.\n\nCoke is enormous and can easily use it's financial resources to find cleaner ways to produce bottles. \nIt's last of commitment simply boils down to greed."

            "message": "Hi Matt, we\u2019ve been involved in the design and running of deposit return schemes systems around the world for many years and so we have a lot of experience of how the system works.  It is true that we\u2019ve expressed concerns about deposit return schemes. Whilst some concerns remain, what\u2019s clear is that recycling rates have stalled and there\u2019s a need to address the issue of recycling and on-the-go littering and we believe we should try something different. We\u2019re looking into how a well-designed deposit return scheme (DRS) could work in Great Britain and have been working with stakeholders in Scotland to understand the best approach. The introduction of these schemes are complex and will take time, requiring many organisations, public and private to work together. We want any planned deposit return scheme to be well-designed, making sure it has the biggest impact on litter and the lowest impact on kerbside collection. \n\nWith regard to your comment about recycled material,  for the last five years, we\u2019ve been using 25% recycled plastic across all our brands, a figure we want to increase to 50% by 2020, but there\u2019s not enough recycled plastic to go beyond that in Great Britain at the moment.
