            "message": "Hi Becky, for the last five years we\u2019ve been using 25% recycled plastic across all our brands, a figure we want to increase to 50% by 2020, but there\u2019s not enough recycled plastic to go beyond that in Great Britain at the moment. This is why as part of our strategy we will be seeking reform of the recycling system in the UK to improve recovery and recycling rates. we\u2019ve been researching and creating alternatives to oil based plastics, such as our PlantBottle\u2122, which is the first-ever recyclable plastic bottle made from plants. We use the PlantBottle for all of our Honest Tea and Smartwater range here in Great Britain and are always looking at ways that we can expand its use across our portfolio."
