        "message": "Plastic bottles can be recycled but plastic degrades every time it's recycled unlike glass or aluminium. Why do you choose to keep using plastic and not just switch back to glass or cans? \n\nYou are responsible for a lot of plastic pollution. Why do you still not support bottle return schemes to further encourage recycling? Why do you only use 10% recycled plastic in your bottles?\n\nYes, consumers need to be encouraged to recycle but it's not the solution to the problem. \n\n#uselessplastic #plasticpollution #plasticocean"
