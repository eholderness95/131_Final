Moreover, plastic has lots of benefits and is fully recyclable. It\u2019s much lighter and uses less material than glass. It also can\u2019t get broken easily so it\u2019s safer. As long as it\u2019s responsibly disposed of, it can be recycled and reused into other packaging or fibre. We\u2019ve also been researching and creating alternatives to oil based plastics, such as our PlantBottle\u2122, which is the first-ever recyclable plastic bottle made from plants. We use the PlantBottle for all of our Honest Tea and Smartwater range here in Great Britain and are always looking at ways that we can expand its use across our portfolio."

We understand that it\u2019s hard to like plastic right now but it does play an essential role in providing food and drink that is clean, safe, convenient and fresh. Plastic packaging is much lighter, has lower carbon impact, uses less energy to manufacture than glass and is fully recyclable. As long as it\u2019s responsibly disposed of, it can be recycled and reused into new packaging or other uses such as fibres and fabric. Recycled plastic also uses around two-thirds less energy than virgin plastic, so as recovery rates and technology improve, plastic will become more sustainable."
