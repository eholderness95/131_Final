        "message": "A step in the right direction for sure bt a long way to go. Before ppl go crazy about 100pc recycled bottles just remember plastic is negentropic meaning the quality of the material is reduced in recycling making it impossible for 100pc recycled plastic bottles. To be honest 50pc is ambitious and will require a great deal of research in order to deliver a safe and reliable product. If u want to make a difference buy glass, it takes more energy to recycle bt has a regeneration rate of 95pc+. Overall lower embodied energy."
