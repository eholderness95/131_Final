            "message": "Hi Farzana, at this stage our focus is on recovering all of our packaging so none of it ends up as litter or in the oceans. However, we\u2019re working hard to ensure our packaging is as sustainable as possible. Plastic has lots of benefits and is fully recyclable. It\u2019s much lighter and uses less material than glass. It also can\u2019t get broken easily so it\u2019s safer. As long as it\u2019s responsibly disposed of, it can be recycled and reused into other packaging or fibre. As part of our strategy, we will be seeking reform of the recycling system in the UK to improve recovery and recycling rates. We are continually evolving our recycling strategy and investing in innovations to support our overall sustainability commitments."
