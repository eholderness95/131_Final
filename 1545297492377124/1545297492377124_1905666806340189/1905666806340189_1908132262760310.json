You should only be using recycled plastics you make more than enough !!!!!! \n\nDo you think as a multi billion pound company for and multi billion pound industry which as a whole is properly accountable for 50% of global plastic waste this is enough ??????\n\nYou CEOs making millions doing nothing you spend millions on advertising you don't really need because let's be honest everyone everywhere know what Coke is. \n\nAnd instead of paying people to clean up your mess you are doing what thousands of other plastic based company's already do !!!! \n\nYou want to make a difference you need to do more join up with green peace instead of giving out holidays for drinking Coke how about holidays when you recycle Coke ???? \n\nI don't know who is in charge but you doing an awful awful job\nAnd the planet is paying for your stupidity"
