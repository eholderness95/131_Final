However, we\u2019re working hard to ensure our packaging is as sustainable as possible. When plastic packaging is responsibly disposed of, it can be recycled and used again and again. We\u2019ve also been researching and creating alternatives to oil based plastics, such as our PlantBottle\u2122, which is the first-ever recyclable plastic bottle made from plants. We use the PlantBottle for all of our Honest Tea and Smartwater range here in Great Britain and are always looking at ways that we can expand its use across our portfolio."
