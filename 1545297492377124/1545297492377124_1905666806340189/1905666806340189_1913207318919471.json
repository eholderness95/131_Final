        "message": "I notice that the bottles in the video do not have the top on and the little round bit of plastic that stays attached to the bottle once you unscrew the top. From seeing this it gives me the impression that your product is still made from different types of plastics and you are once again trying to fool people. Sort out your marketing and start with a product that you put on the shelf that can be completely recycled. With the size of your company there must be a profit to be made from completely reusing the whole of your products produced."

We\u2019ve spent many years ensuring all of our drinks packaging is fully recyclable, from our lids to the type of glue we use to stick on the labels and the colour of PET plastic. Thanks"
