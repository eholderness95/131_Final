        "message": "I thought that the reason large companies like Coca-Cola don't use recycled plastic for their bottles is due to the fact that the bottles wouldn't be completely clear and they feel that it would be detrimental to their future sales as consumers would find less appeal in a cloudy looking drink bottle? I'm sure that the lack of recycled plastic might be one of the reasons why you're not using 100% recycled plastic  but is the cloudy appearance another?"
