            "message": "Hi Tom, the UK  industry and retailers stopped using refillable packaging many years ago partly because of the space and complexity required to manage this type of system. They will always remain an option for future sustainable packaging. However, it\u2019s a change that would require a significant reinvestment and a change along the whole supply chain in the UK. In our strategy for Great Britain, we\u2019ve focused on the actions we think will make the biggest impact in a near future. We\u2019re committed to supporting any well-designed initiative that could improve recovering and recycling rates, including a deposit return scheme. Ultimately that decision must be led by Government but requiring many organisations, \u2013 public and private \u2013 to work in partnership."
