        "message": "Coca-Cola although I applause your efforts to promote sustainability and encourage recycling, I wonder why you don't just roll-out the use of biodegradable PlantBottles across the whole range? That would make more sense. \nI do are that the public are also responsible to make efforts to recycle however - despite the governments efforts to roll out recycling collection across the country, many ppl still fail to do so and even litter! It's a complex problem, stop pussy footing around and take the lead. BAN PLASTIC entirely unless it's biodegradable."
