        "message": "If only there was some kind of comment that expressed my dislike of aspartame in Zero and Diet coke that fit numerically and so answered the question... Hmm... Nope, can't be bothered to waste any more time thinking of one.\nLove normal coke though. Could drink it all day if I wasn't borderline diabetic 2 years ago, not anymore though thankfully but I'd rather not come that close again ;-) still, a coke a day keeps... My taste buds awake? :-D\n\nI'll go with 65"
