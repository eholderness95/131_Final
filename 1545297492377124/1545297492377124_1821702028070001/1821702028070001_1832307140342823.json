        "message": "Apparently you are lobbying to stop simple deposit return schemes that would reduce plastic bottle pollution by millions.  These plastic bottles fill up our landfills and litter our beaches and oceans causing injury and death to animal and fish life.  You could get a lot of kudos by advertising that you will have a simple bottle deposit scheme to help the earth and environment.  PLEASE DO."
