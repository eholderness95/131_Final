        "message": "Hello Jaquie, thanks for your message. We support recovery and recycling of our packaging and we want to help find ways to ensure that less of it ends up where it shouldn\u2019t. We\u2019re currently reviewing our sustainable packaging strategy and we have been speaking to experts in this area. We\u2019ll publish more details on this later in the year but in the meantime it is clear to us that the time is now right to trial a well-designed deposit return scheme in Scotland.
