        "message": "Tried messaging this but no reply...\nHi, are you discontinuing Coke Life? It's no longer available in Tesco, and today my local Morrisons had 9 different varieties of Coke but not Life. We've bought it there previously several times when they (and Tesco) had it on offer - 2 x 8-packs for \u00a35. We're trying to reduce sugar but won't have artificial sweeteners, so Coke Life was the ideal option."
