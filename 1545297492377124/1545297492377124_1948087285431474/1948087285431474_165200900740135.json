        "message": "I would love so much to go on Saturday and take my roommate Magdalena von Buchwaldt with me. After three months of studying in London, the weekend of the Jingle Bell Ball is unfortunately our last one before going back home to Germany. Seeing so many amazing artists on one concert live in the O2 arena would be a dream come true and the perfect ending of a wonderful time abroad. \ud83d\ude0d #jinglebellball #capitalfm #capitalJBB #cocacola"
