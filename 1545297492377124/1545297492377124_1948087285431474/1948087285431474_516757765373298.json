        "message": "I would absolutely love to go on Saturday 9th with my older sister, because recently she has become painfully ill which has become really hard for me to watch because I can't do anything to help her! Going to this event will help take her mind of things especially if she got to see Sam Smith live, this would be so appreciated and definitely would put a smile on her face which is something I haven't seen in a long time \u2764\ufe0f\n\n#CapitalFM #cocacola #CapitalJBB #mysisterismyworld \n#holidaysarecoming\n#jinglebellball"
