This would be a great piece of advertising/marketing for coca cola as she is basically (almost) named after one of the best carbonated beverages in the world. Nicola and I go ever year to the Jingle Bell Ball, please Coca-Cola and Capital FM don't break the tradition! #CapitalJBB #Holidaysarecoming (Sunday tickets please!!!)"
