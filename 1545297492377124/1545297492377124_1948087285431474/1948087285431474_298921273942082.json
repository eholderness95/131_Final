My favourite singer is Taylor Swift as well, so to see her on that weekend would be amazing; performing for the first time in the uk with her new songs! \u2764\ufe0f I would bring along Charlie, my boyfriend \ud83d\ude1c as we\u2019ve never been to the o2 either! #cocacola #CapitalFM #CapitalJBB #holidaysarecoming"
