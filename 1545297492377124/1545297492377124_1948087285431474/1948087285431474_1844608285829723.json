        "message": "I would be forever indebted to you capital if I could go to the Jingle bell ball on Sunday 10th December! ! I have been trying to buy tickets for the last 10 years and that is no exaggeration! \nThis year I was in the queue and got to 52nd in line only to be told it was sold out \ud83d\ude2d I don't normally get that far and I almost smashed my laptop out of disappointment \ud83d\ude02 I've even tried winning on air, spent a ton on credit to play!\nWhy do I want to go? I've only been waiting a decade to no avail!\nThis year's line up is absolutely immense and I would love love love to be there \u2661 I have never been to a 'concert' in my life \ud83d\ude22 this and the summer time ball are the only ones I've been interested in and I've never had the chance :( \nI'm not going to go on with my sob story (there's more \ud83d\ude02) but this would be a dream come true! Genuinely.\nI had planned to go with my bestest Dany Bolton and it folded at the last moment. \nYou say it sold out in record timing, 45 mins. I was online before 8 am and in line until 8:06am when the page closed and said it had sold out \ud83d\ude2d \nI am obsessed with Ed sheeran,  Taylor Swift and the script. So Ofcourse the 10th would be my first pick, but I Saturday will be massive too! Omg I need in! \ud83c\udfb6\n#capitalJBB #holidaysarecoming #cocacola #obsessed #ineedthisinmylife\n#JBBvirgin #letmein #please #prettyplease #capitalofficial"
