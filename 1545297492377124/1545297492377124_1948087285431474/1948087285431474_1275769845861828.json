It would literally mean the world to me to see Taylor perform live like if i won i would be so happy i would literally cry...(im not even joking\ud83d\ude02) Taylor is literally one of my favourite people and i was so annoyed that i am not able to afford tickets. Ps i have always wanted to go to the jingle bell ball as you always have some many artists that i adore :) also attached a pic of me with my reputation magazine today. This album is literally my JAM right now. If you haven't heard it go and buy it. It is amazing!! I'm so happy and proud of Taylor \ud83d\ude00 \ud83d\ude18 good luck everyone \ud83d\udc96 #CapitalJBB #CAPITALFM #CocaCola"
