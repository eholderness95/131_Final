        "message": "Coca Cola's reply to my message to them :\nThanks for getting in touch. We recognise that marine litter is a serious global issue that requires action from everybody \u2013 Governments, environmental groups, communities and, of course, businesses. We are open to working with others to create long-term, effective solutions.\n\nHere in Great Britain, all our bottles and cans are 100% recyclable; we have reduced the amount of packaging we by use by 15 percent since 2007; and we currently use 25 percent recycled plastic in all of our bottles. We are also actively involved in conversations with policy makers and other experts about what more can be done to reduce litter and improve recycling and recovery rates. We are one of the companies who have agreed to join a working group established by the Government to identify new ways of tackling littering, such as deposit systems on plastic bottles.\n\nIf you want to know more about what we are doing on packaging, please click here\n\nThank you for replying and I understand that a big decision is required by governments etc BUT the revenue Coca Cola makes annually is enormous and your companies efforts are only token gestures. \n\nAny change to resolving your plastic footprint requires total commitment which you are presently NOT taking! \n\nPlease take a proper look at the damage your creating and find a solution yourselves -  please creat the change yourselves - which is necessary now!\n\nNo Director or employee who once properly sees the damage you are causing can really ignore this issue. \n\nPlease be LEADERS and make Coca Cola a brand name we can all be proud of! \ud83d\udc9a\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn 27 May 2017, at 09:17, Coca-Cola Replies <info@cokecce.com> wrote:\n\nThanks for getting in touch.
