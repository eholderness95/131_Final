Perhaps Coca-Cola has a certain degree of responsibility, e.g. It could send out a message and request all those who buy their product, to ensure they dispose of their can/bottle properly. Besides from that, its society that is to blame, the lazy and careless people. My friends ALWAYS litters, and I go crazy when she does it, it's her choice, she's in the wrong, and in years to come, she will regret it."

That gives them a huge responsibility which they fail to live up to."

            "message": "Hi Sara, thanks for getting in touch. We\u2019d hate to see any of our bottles or cans ending up where they shouldn\u2019t and want as many of them as possible to be recycled so that we can use them to make into new bottles and cans again. We\u2019re also proud to say that all of our bottles and cans in Great Britain are 100% recyclable and have been since 2012. This means that all our drinks packaging can be recycled at home or when you\u2019re out and about.   \n\nWe know sustainability, and recycling specifically, is a vital issue to address and that\u2019s why we\u2019re currently in the process of reviewing our sustainable packaging strategy which we will publish in the summer. To keep up to date, please head to: www.coca-cola.co.uk/sustainability-section"
