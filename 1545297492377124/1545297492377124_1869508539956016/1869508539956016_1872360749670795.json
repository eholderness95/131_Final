            "message": "Hi George, thanks for getting in touch and apologies for the delay in responding. We recognise that sustainability is an important issue and it\u2019s one that we care about deeply as a company. We\u2019d hate to see any of our bottles or cans ending up where they shouldn\u2019t and want as many of them as possible to be recycled so that we can use them to make into new bottles and cans again. We\u2019re proud to say that all of our bottles and cans in Great Britain are 100% recyclable and have been since 2012. This means that all our drinks packaging can be recycled at home or when you\u2019re out and about.  At the moment, at least 25% of the material in all of our bottles is recycled plastic, our aluminium cans contain around 42% recycled aluminium and there\u2019s 47% recycled glass in our glass bottles. And we want to go further: we\u2019re  committed to increasing the amount of recycled and renewable material in our plastic bottles from 25% to 40% by 2020. It\u2019s a very complex problem, and we\u2019ve not got all the answers yet,  but we\u2019re fully committed to finding new ways to minimise the materials we use, reducing waste, and working with others to improve recycling rates across Great Britain.
