        "message": "Coca-Cola make over 100 billion single-use plastic bottles every single year. 90% of seabirds now have plastic in their stomachs. Our seabirds are choking because of plastic found on our beaches, in landfill and in the sea.  Once in the sea, Coca-cola's plastic bottles take 450 YEARS to break down.  Coca-Cola claim that all their bottles and cans are 100% recyclable.  But do they actually know or understand what 100% recyclable actually means in practical terms?  Are they even aware of the actual processes involved in recycling plastic?  And how much energy and resource it costs to recycle plastic (when and if it does actually happen)?"
