We need people to not be afraid to discuss these important topics. \nIn simple terms, the human race is fast becoming advanced but it is failing to take on the responsibilities of being advanced. We cannot sit by and watch cruelty to animals because of our ignorance and irresponsible behaviours. \nWhen businesses invent products it has a duty to consider the impact upon our planet and its inhabitants; all animals and plants should be protected. Our race has become arrogant and indifferent to all life around us and we need to realise we have a duty to protect all life on this planet.\n\nAs children we have an excuse but as parents we have to teach our children. As adults we have a responsibility, yet we are presently not stepping up! \n\n\u2764\ufe0f"

They also have a responsibility. \nPutting it simply, we ALL have a duty to be responsible but let's remember these manufacturers make an awful lot of money and what they should be doing with their profits is researching for better, less harmful ways to protect our planet and if this means changing the product all together then so be it! \n\nIf I invented a product that was harmful to life, isn't it my duty to be responsible for this product? Asbestos is a good example of a deadly product AND likewise plastics is , it is being eaten by animals and so is this any less dangerous? No! \n\nPlease let's not argue for the sake of just wanting to win, please let's talk and consider what is right and proper because what is at stake is much more than just our egos! \n\n\u2764\ufe0f"
