Your fans don\u2019t think so!\nWe loved you as you were, a friend not a foe.\nYou were just sweet enough, with the right type of bubbles\nYou were there for our wins, consoled us through troubles,\nPepsi Max was our choice, before you came along,\nYou gave us a reason, to sing Coke\u2019s festive song.\nBut now you have changed, and we miss you a lot.\nGoodbye Coke Zero, once the best that it got."
