        "message": "I've been lucky enough to see Ed Sheeran live, but I wasn't able to take my beautiful girlfriend, who would LOVE to meet the guy. He seems like a genuinely decent person full of personality, and to get the chance to meet him, talk about his career, his future family, everything, would be outstanding. It would honestly be a blessing, a true tick on the bucket list! His music has influenced and inspired generations for sure, and I'd love the chance to show my appreciation!"
