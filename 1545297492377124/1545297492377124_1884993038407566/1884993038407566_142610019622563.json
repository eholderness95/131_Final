        "message": "Last time I saw Ed Sheeran in Dublin, I had cued for 12 hours to get right to the very front of the standing... I then cried from the second he walked on the stage and throughout the whole concert till after he'd left the stage. He is my absolute inspiration and the reason I write my own music! Ed bring so much joy to my life and I just love him so much!! Ive been really wishing that Ed would do smaller gigs again like he used to, and this is just the most perfect set up and opportunity for me!! SEEING ED UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WOULD BE MY DREAM COME TRUE \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f"
