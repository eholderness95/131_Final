I couldnt get tickets for his devide tour sold out in minutes and a lot of greedy ticket touts ruining it for so many of us. All of my friends entered every competition to win me tickets as they knew how much it meant to me! I stupidly paid through the nose for 2 tickets to his glasgow show to find i had been ripped off. I was devastated and couldn't get my money back to top it off \ud83d\ude22 people can be so cruel \ud83d\udc94.  Love you Ed !!!"
