I'm not gonna make up a sob story about  how my dads uncles, nephews, aunties dog just died so I'm so upset I need to meet him. Nah I just think we could have a decent conversation about chicken and ketchup. Although I think I love ketchup more than he does. Respect to who ever made Heinz like! #teddy"
