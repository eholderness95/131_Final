            "message": "Hi Janet, at this stage, our focus is on recovering all of our packaging so none of it ends up as litter or in the oceans. We\u2019ve worked with a number of experts and organisations to understand where we should focus our efforts. Plastic has lots of benefits and is fully recyclable. It\u2019s much lighter and uses less material than glass. It also can\u2019t get broken easily so it\u2019s safer. As long as it\u2019s responsibly disposed of, it can be recycled and reused into other packaging or fibre. As part of our strategy, we will be seeking reform of the recycling system in the UK to improve recovery and recycling rates. We are continually evolving our recycling strategy and investing in innovations to support our overall sustainability commitments. However, solutions to such a vast environmental challenge require collaboration across industries, NGOs, governments, and communities. We agree that action is needed, are open to doing more and to working with others to create long-term, effective solutions. For more, read here: http://spr.ly/61848A4Vg"

Let's hope they get rolled out asap where people can gain access to easily. Of coke then up the recycled content of their bottles to 100% or certainly a lot higher then I'll believe that you are serious about sustainability. \ud83d\ude0a"
