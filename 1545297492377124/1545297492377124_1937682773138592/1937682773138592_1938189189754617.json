Please use 100% recycled plastic in your bottles and help reduce the detrimental impact the company has on the environment.

            "message": "Hi Richard, we\u2019re proud to say that all of our packaging in GB is 100% recyclable. For the last five years, we\u2019ve been using 25% recycled plastic across all our brands, a figure we want to increase to 50% by 2020, but there\u2019s not enough recycled plastic to go beyond that in Great Britain at the moment. This is why as part of our strategy we will be seeking reform of the recycling system in the UK to improve recovery and recycling rates. We are continually evolving our recycling strategy and investing in innovations to support our overall sustainability commitments. For more info please visit: http://spr.ly/61848A4ry"
