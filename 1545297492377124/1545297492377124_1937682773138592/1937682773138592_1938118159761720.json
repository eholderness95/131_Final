            "message": "Hi Evie, at this stage our focus is on recovering all of our packaging so none of it ends up as litter or in the oceans. However, we\u2019re working hard to ensure our packaging is as sustainable as possible. When plastic packaging is responsibly disposed of, it can be recycled and used again and again. We\u2019ve also been researching and creating alternatives to oil based plastics, such as our PlantBottle\u2122, which is the first-ever recyclable plastic bottle made from plants. We use the PlantBottle for all of our Honest Tea and Smartwater range here in Great Britain and are always looking at ways that we can expand its use across our portfolio. In the UK, the industry and retailers stopped using refillable packaging many years ago partly because of the space and complexity required to manage this type of system. They will always remain an option for future sustainable packaging. However, it\u2019s a change that would require a significant reinvestment and a change along the whole supply chain in the UK. In our strategy for Great Britain, we\u2019ve focused on the actions we think will make the biggest impact in a near future. We\u2019re committed to supporting any well-designed initiative that could improve recovering and recycling rates, including a deposit-return scheme. Ultimately that decision must be led by Government but requiring many organisations, \u2013 public and private \u2013 to work in partnership."

I know many people have stoped purchasing single use bottles, so it is in your interested to phase them out as soon as possible"
