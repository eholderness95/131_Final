            "message": "Hi Roger, for the last five years we\u2019ve been using 25% recycled plastic across all our brands, a figure we want to increase to 50% by 2020, but there\u2019s not enough recycled plastic to go beyond that in Great Britain at the moment. This is why as part of our strategy we will be seeking reform of the recycling system in the UK to improve recovery and recycling rates. We\u2019re looking into how a well-designed deposit-return scheme (DRS) could work in Great Britain. The introduction of these schemes is complex and ultimately is a decision that must be led by Government, requiring many organisations, public and private to work together. We want any planned deposit-return scheme to be well-designed, making sure it has the biggest impact on litter and the lowest impact on kerbside collection and have been working with stakeholders in Scotland to understand the best approach."
