The power that we have as a consumer is to stop buying their product until it is sold in either a bio degradable container or one that doesn't take hundreds of years to breakdown and is polluting the planet. Not all counties have sophisticated recycling facilities. I have never seen a Tv advert by coke to bin you bottle, more than happy to feed you how great your life will be if you buy a bottle but not what to do with it."

You need to check your comments - I haven't seen any Coca Cola trucks cleaning up streets or in fact I haven't seen them funding any environmental clean ups - happy to be proven wrong.  What is the point of saving all the children when they will most probably be living in those counties drowning in single use plastic.  When you have polluted the last river, destroyed your environment you will realise you can't eat money - but you can still drink coke \ud83d\udc4d"

            "message": "Hi Kerry, at this stage our focus is on recovering all of our packaging so none of it ends up as litter. However, we\u2019re working hard to ensure our packaging is as sustainable as possible. We\u2019ve worked with a number of experts and organisations to understand where we should focus our efforts. Plastic has lots of benefits and is fully recyclable. It\u2019s much lighter and uses less material than glass. It also can\u2019t get broken easily so it\u2019s safer. As long as it\u2019s responsibly disposed of, it can be recycled and reused into other packaging or fibre. We\u2019ve also been researching and creating alternatives to oil-based plastics, such as our PlantBottle\u2122, which is the first-ever recyclable plastic bottle made from plants. We use the PlantBottle for all of our Honest Tea and Smartwater range here in Great Britain and are always looking at ways that we can expand its use across our portfolio. We\u2019ve also launched our biggest ever ad campaign to inspire more of our consumers to recycle and champion new ways to improve packaging recovery. Our new strategy aims to make sure none of our bottles or cans end up where they shouldn\u2019t! This is why as part of our strategy we will be seeking reform of the recycling system in the UK to improve recovery and recycling rates. For more info please visit: http://spr.ly/61898A4X3"
