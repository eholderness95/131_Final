If you buy the cokes from certain self run shops sometimes you can find a coke that taste like the middle eastern ones, but not in Main Street shops. It taste so much better in Israel. I've drink so much coke these past two months and I still haven't won a holiday \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02"

However it's possible for it to vary slightly in taste due to such factors as temperature, foods with which it is served, storage conditions or even ice cubes. Hope this helps."
