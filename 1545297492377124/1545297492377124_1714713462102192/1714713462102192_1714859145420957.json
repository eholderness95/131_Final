        "message": "Dearest Coke, my 7 year old son would like to know why a bottle of Coke purchased by his daddy in Belfast features this competition but is only applicable to those from England, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man and the Chanel Islands. Why is Northern Ireland excluded from your little marketing ploy? Especially since, unlike Scotland, the Chanel Islands and the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland will actually be featuring in the Euros. In respond of a fair and rational explanation.... Regards..//tastethefeelingeverywherebuthere\ud83e\udd14"
