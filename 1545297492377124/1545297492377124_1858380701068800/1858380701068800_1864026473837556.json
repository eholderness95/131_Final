            "message": "Hi Laura, thanks for getting in touch. We recognise that sustainability is an important issue and it\u2019s one that we care about deeply as a company. We\u2019d hate to see any of our bottles or cans ending up where they shouldn\u2019t and want as many of them as possible to be recycled so that we can use them to make into new bottles and cans again. We want to make sure we use the least amount of plastic, aluminium or glass in each container and that as much recycled material as possible makes into new cans and bottles.  At the moment, at least 25% of the material in all of our bottles is recycled plastic and we want to go further. We\u2019re  committed to increasing the amount of recycled and renewable material in our plastic bottles from 25% to 40% by 2020. \n\nWe know sustainability, and recycling specifically, is a vital issue to address and that\u2019s why we\u2019re currently in the process of reviewing our sustainable packaging strategy which we will publish in the summer. Deposit return schemes are also a big part of these discussions as more people are looking for ways to increase recycling rates. So while our review is still ongoing, it\u2019s clear to us that the time is right to trial a well-designed deposit scheme for drinks containers, starting in Scotland where conversations are underway already.\n\nIt\u2019s a very complex problem, and we\u2019ve not got all the answers yet,  but we\u2019re fully committed to finding new ways to minimise the materials we use, reducing waste, and working with others to improve recycling rates across Great Britain.
