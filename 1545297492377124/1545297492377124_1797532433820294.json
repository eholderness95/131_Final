        "message": "I have a query about Share a Coke and the named bottles. When this was out in the UK, I ordered glass bottles for the whole family. However since then, we have a new addition to the family, but we are unable to find anywhere in the UK where we can buy a named Coke bottle with our daughters name on.\nAll children are special to their parents, but Ruby is our \"Rainbow\" baby, having been born after we suffered loss of another child. So we are hoping the service will return to the UK soon.\nI see that Share a Coke service is available in the US, with 8oz glass bottles available to personalise and buy, but not in the UK.\nI ask if the service will be extended to the UK anytime soon, or am I going to be consigned to using Photoshop to fake a bottle for my daughter."
