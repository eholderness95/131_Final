        "message": "To be honest I liked Ed Sheeran then I took my sister to see him for her 16th birthday and saw him live. He was amazing. \nI went to see him again this year in Birmingham and was a little dissapointed when he didn't really talk to the crowd he just sang. \nI would love the chance to all him why. I felt as though it had lost the Ed feeling. \n\nStill love the music though. Xxx"
