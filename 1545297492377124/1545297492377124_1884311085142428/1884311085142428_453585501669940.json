        "message": "I've been an Ed Sheeran fan for years. And in that time, I've known many losses, suffered with anxiety and depression and been heartbroken. His songs have lifted me up and spoken to me on so many levels. It's a connection I can't feel with any other musician. I'm truly grateful for his music and it keeps me going; I'd simply love to win this and having recently been diagnosed with endometriosis following surgery, it'd bring me out of the pothole I've fallen into \u2764\ufe0f"
