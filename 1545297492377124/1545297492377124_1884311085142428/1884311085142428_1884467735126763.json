Have loved ed Sheeran since day one and I am trying my hardest on capital to grab a ticket but again failing! My dream in to see him even if its just once as its so hard to get tickets for any of his gig! Would do anything to get my hands on 2 tickets for me and my partner!\n\ud83d\udc99\ud83c\udf99\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude29\ud83c\udf8a"
