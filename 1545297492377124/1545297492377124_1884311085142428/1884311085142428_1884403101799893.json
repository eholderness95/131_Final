        "message": "It's my boyfriend's 18th birthday in a month's time and he's a massive ed sheeran fan. I think he actually loves ed more than he loves me. I tried to get him surprise tickets but by the time I got to the website they had all sold out!He's also been through a really hard time with his parents splitting up and his grandad becoming extremely ill. He has always been there for me a I think for him to be able to see his idol will just give him that extra push to carry on. \ud83d\ude1e\u2764\ufe0f"
