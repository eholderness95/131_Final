        "message": "I know my reason isn't really as important as others but well... I absolutely love Ed Sheeran and my dream has always been to attend one of his concerts. I've never been to a concert before despite me being 18, as I don't have much money and struggle with it a lot. I don't treat myself enough so I thought maybe if I win some tickets that would be great! Winning these would be amazing however if I don't I want to say good luck to those who do and hope they have a blast!\ud83d\ude0a"
