Each year we try our best to add new locations to our tour so everyone has a chance to be able to experience the truck tour on the build-up to Christmas, sadly, it's not possible for us to visit every place. However, we'll take your comment into consideration. Thanks"

In previous years we have visited many different locations across GB, but sadly, we can't visit every one, each year. We understand that you might be disappointed and will be sure to share your feedback with our teams."
