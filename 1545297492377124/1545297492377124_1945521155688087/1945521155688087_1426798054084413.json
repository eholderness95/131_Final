In previous years we have visited many different locations across GB, but sadly, we can't visit every single one, each year. We can understand that you might be disappointed and will be sure to share your feedback with our teams"

In past years it would start in Inverness and work its way down fairly throughout the UK. It\u2019s just disappointing more than anything."
