I thought you were in Exeter on December 10th? I could have traveled there. Gutted as I\u2019m not going to get to see it yet some places have it multiple times. Can you not add either Taunton, Bridgwater, street or Exeter ? So many here will miss out as there\u2019s a huge gap either side of where we live."
