            "message": "Hi Silver, the truck tour is a huge logistical challenge and takes our teams months of planning in advance with both councils and communities. In previous years we have visited many different locations across GB, but sadly, we can't visit every single one, each year. We're really sad to hear you're disappointed and will be sure to share your feedback with our teams."
