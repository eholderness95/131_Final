But you go to Watford twice.  \nLoved coming to see you at Bluewater shopping Centre but nothing close this year.  \nI think you need to look at your routes.  I understand not being able to around everywhere but why have 2 visits right next to each other I.e. Watford."

However, we'll take your comment into consideration. Thanks"
