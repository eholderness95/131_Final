To keep you entertained, we'll be joined by graffiti artist Jerome Davenport, who will be live painting 20 custom-designed #FreestyleStudio skateboards. \n\nBut if that wasn't enough, we'll also be giving you the chance to win one. You'll need to head on down to Urban Food Fest and enjoy a Freestyle on us for your chance to win. Terms and Conditions apply, click here: www.cocacola.co.uk/legal/freestyleUFF"
