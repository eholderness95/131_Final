            "message": "Coca-Cola not true. retailers within the UK - such as supermarkets do deals with the brands to reach prices such as price deals. and when your brand reduced the product size from 2 ltr to 1.75 ltr there was no price drop. but still if you keep claiming that prices are set by retailers then you can stop this permanently by printing the price of what customers should be paying on the brand with a RRP stamp! many retailer permanently sell 2 ltr bottles of your rival brand for \u00a31 and 600ml bottles for 45p - this is because of deals set with the brand with buying power. however most supermarkets price fix and double these prices and only lower them with fake half price deals which are usually the real RRP!"
