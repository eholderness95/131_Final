The first fully recyclable plastic bottle made partly with a special plastic which comes from plant material, which means we don\u2019t have to use as much petroleum-based plastic. We\u2019ve embarked on a major review of our sustainable packaging strategy. To keep up to date please visit www.coca-cola.co.uk/sustainability-section"

That\u2019s why we\u2019re currently in the process of reviewing our sustainable packaging strategy which we will publish later this year. Deposit return schemes have been a big part of these discussions as more people are looking for ways to increase recycling rates. So while our review is still ongoing, it\u2019s clear to us that the time is right to trial a well-designed deposit scheme for drinks containers, starting in Scotland where conversations are underway already.
