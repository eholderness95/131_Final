        "message": "Would love to win to see the killers!! As me & the husband approach 30, we've been looking back on our youth and through pangs of nostalgia have been thinking about all of the bands from our past who we never got to see and have since disbanded or concentrated on solo material. As someone who was a uni student in the mid-late noughties, Mr Brightside was of course our anthem and now as everyone from within the uni group go off and get married, we still have it played as our anthem at every wedding \ud83d\ude02 (see below). Also considering tickets for this are now sold out and I never managed to get my hands on any, this just spurs my need to win them on even more!! Please let it be meee and let me re-live my youth one more time haha!"
