            "message": "Hi Tina, all of our bottles and cans in Great Britain are 100% recyclable and can be recycled at home or when you\u2019re out and about. This means that all our drinks packaging can be recycled at home or when you\u2019re out and about. We know sustainability, and recycling specifically, is a vital issue to address and that\u2019s why we\u2019re currently in the process of reviewing our sustainable packaging strategy which we will publish later this year. To keep up to date, please head to: www.coca-cola.co.uk/sustainability-section"
