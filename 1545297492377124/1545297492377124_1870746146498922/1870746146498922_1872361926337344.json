        "message": "Do all your bottles come with the code on them?  We have some Coke Zero 2L bottles with the promotional label on them, but there doesn't appear to be a PIN under the lid.  There is a code (letter followed by 3 numbers) but this keeps showing an 'Oops' message when entered.  It is also engraved on to the black lid rather than written onto a white insert, which makes me think it isn't correct.  Any ideas?"
