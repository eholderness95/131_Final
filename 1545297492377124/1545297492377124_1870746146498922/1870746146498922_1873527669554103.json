        "message": "I have been trying to log into the site via my Facebook account. It comes up with a message box saying that \"WE FOUND AN EXISTING ACCOUNT  (for my email address) and gives the option to \"CONNECT THIS SESSION WITH YOUR EXISTING ACCOUNT\" (which I chose) or to CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT USING FACEBOOK LOGIN and there is another button on the bottom with the FB logo and Connect on it. However, when I click on the connect button, nothing happens. I tried logging in with just my email and requesting a password but it comes back saying that I have registered via FB, so back to the beginning. Why isn't it letting me log in?"
