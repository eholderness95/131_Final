However, a few of our drinks contain small traces of fish gelatine, these products are Lilt, Lilt Zero, Kia-Ora Orange Squash No Added Sugar and Schweppes Orange Squash. Hope this helps."

Fish are not mammals, so you have not answered a question that all other companies answer simply: Are any of your products vegan? For clarification, a vegetarian does not eat any dead animals (including fish) or products that are a direct result of dead animals (such as gelatine) - a vegan does not eat ANY animal product."
