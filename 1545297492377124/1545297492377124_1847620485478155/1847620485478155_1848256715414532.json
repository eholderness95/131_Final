Hi Coca-Cola team, I'm just trying to spread the word about my 3R's Waste Plastic Container Gardening ideas to HELP reduce millions of tonnes of WASTE PLASTIC containers like yours from going to landfill and water, and I'm trying to HELP FEED millions of people at the same time, done in my own way, which YOU might like to get involved in, simply done by makeing two rings around your plastic bottle where people could cut along to make a handle on a TWO PLANTER as shown in my photo to carry or rest on a flat surface to grow things, which I've done for many years. EXAMPLE isn't another way to teach, it IS the way to teach, from me John.JRP. www.recycling.moonfruit.com"
