            "message": "Hi Aga, thanks for getting in touch. We\u2018re genuinely sorry to hear that you dislike the new taste. Coca-Cola Zero already tasted great but we\u2019ve been working to see if we can bring the taste even closer to the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. We think this will encourage even more people to try a no sugar version of Coca-Cola and will help people who are looking to reduce their sugar intake. The reaction from consumers in taste tests has been really positive and results show a significant improvement in the number of people who agree that the new drink tastes even more like Coke. However, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your comments with us and we will certainly share your feedback with our brand team. Thanks"
