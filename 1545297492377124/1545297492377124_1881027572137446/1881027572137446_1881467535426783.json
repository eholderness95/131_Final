Since 2012, all of our bottles and cans in Great Britain have been and are 100% recyclable. This means that all our drinks packaging can be recycled at home or when you\u2019re out and about.  We\u2019re  currently in the process of reviewing our sustainable packaging strategy which we will publish in the summer. Deposit return schemes are also a big part of these discussions as more people are looking for ways to increase recycling rates.
