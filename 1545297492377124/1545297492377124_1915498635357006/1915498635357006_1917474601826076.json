        "message": "just tried my first can of the new Coke Zero Sugar, instead of my regular classic coke. I'm sorry Coca Cola but the taste is so far removed from Classic Coke that I had to drink a Classic Coke to get rid of the nasty taste left in my mouth left by the new Zero Sugar. The Zero Sugar tastes reminds me of one thing, and one thing only. When I have been anaesthetised in hospital and at the dentists with the masks. Will never buy the Zero Sugar again"
