        "message": "When questioned on Coca-Cola Life earlier this month, the brand\u2019s marketing director for the UK and Ireland Bobby Brittain insisted the variant was never meant to be \u201cmore than a niche\u201d and that Coca-Cola\u2019s focus is on Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.\n\nTo find Coca-Cola Life is like a treasure hunt! Maybe because too healthy and not full of chemical sweeteners! \nI want to find the Coca-Cola Life in the shops exactly like the other Coca-Cola"
