        "message": "Just an update for anyone who is interested including those who have sarcastically commented who are employees of Coca Cola! I was informed that because I was unable to provide manufacturing information based on the bottom of 1 of the cans in question that there is nothing that they can do! & as a consequence nothing to investigate! Furthermore if you buy a product of Coca Cola & it does not have the Uxbridge Middlesex address or UB postcode then assume that the product is a foreign import, made with cheap labour no doubt to enable maximum profit at the Supermarkets / grocers / cash & carry. No apology given by the customer service representative at the start only sorry that I felt that my co plaint had not been taken Seriously when I refused to give my name & advised the story will unfold across social media. Very disappointed in Coca Cola."
