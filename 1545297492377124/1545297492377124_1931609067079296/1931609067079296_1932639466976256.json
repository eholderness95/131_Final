            "message": "Hi Rowena, for the last five years we\u2019ve been using 25% recycled plastic across all our brands, a figure we want to increase to 50% by 2020, but there\u2019s not enough recycled plastic to go beyond that in Great Britain at the moment. This is why as part of our strategy we will be seeking reform of the recycling system in the UK to improve recovery and recycling rates. We also use PlantBottle for all of our Honest and glaceau smartwater bottles in Great Britain, it\u2019s the first-ever fully recyclable PET plastic bottle made partially from plants and we\u2019re always looking at ways that we can expand its use across our portfolio.
