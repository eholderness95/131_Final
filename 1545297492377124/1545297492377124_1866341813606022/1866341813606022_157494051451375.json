        "message": "Personally, i love  it. The idea of a sister and brother competing over a dude who has far more clothes on than the traditional ads. And experience got in first. Also, theres a difference in the objectification of a man here than women... firstly, he isnt cavorting in just his underwear or something body-hugging, secondly, the tone isn't about possession. Women tend to be possessed and made to serve, the characters in this were seeking to impress by serving rather than seeking to claim and own. Its a subtle difference but an important one. It's making fun of the old coke ads, a point many seem to have missed."
