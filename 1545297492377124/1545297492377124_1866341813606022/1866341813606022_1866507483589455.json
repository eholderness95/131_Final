What the problem is that men have been threatened off of ogling woman and advertising media never shows this anywhere. Men are eye candy, stupid or geeks not only that but woman are actively shown to look . Or lazy Woman are smart, beautiful (what ever they look like) and hard working. I ask you to go out and tell me any advert that does not fit this..find me an ad where men are checking out woman in the same way."
