We arent trying to be noticed and make people aware we exist all the time, if anything its the opposite we'd like to go unnoticed, for it to not be a thing that you have to be strikingly aware theres a gay guy in this advert. No one would bat an eyelid if it was 2 women competing for that guys affections. So why does it need to be a thing when theres a guy competing?"
