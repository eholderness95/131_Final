        "message": "Dear Coca-Cola, \n\nI recently got one of your free Coca-Cola vouchers by via bus stop adverts as part of your Coca-Cola Zero campaign with Asda. However ASDA stores are unaware of this campaign which the voucher for a free Coca-Cola zero barcode isn't recognised on their systems. \n\nWhen I went to customer service desk was very offended when the voucher came through as a money off rather than a free bottle of 500ml Coca-Cola zero.\n\nYour campaign is clearly just pseudo, and a complete waste of my time and money as I spent \u00a33 on bus fair just to get to my nearest ASDA store. Thank you for wasting my time and money.  I have reported you to an advertising service that has had great success in fining your company I've just submitted to them.\n\nOh I work for an advertising company that works for your company. Suggest you be very careful how you treat me."
