Listen to this person being paid to tell you what we want her to tell you. Rita Ora is a great mouthpiece for coke. Go and buy coke now knowing that we pay celebrities who take our money to tell you which one of our drinks are best. The one we're advertising. Buy our stuff. This person has been paid to tell you to buy our stuff. K thx bye."
