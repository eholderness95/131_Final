Therefore we wouldn't be able to accommodate your request at this late stage and are not able to change or deviate away from our current route or timetable. We're sure you can appreciate that the Christmas Truck tour takes months of planning in advance and it\u2019s a huge logistical challenge. However, we would suggest contacting us in the summer next year."
