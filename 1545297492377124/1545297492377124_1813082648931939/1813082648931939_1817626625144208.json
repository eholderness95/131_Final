Please don\u2019t be so sad, \nCoca-Cola Zero Sugar is the best we\u2019ve ever had!\nIt\u2019s much more like Coke Classic, and still bursting with flavour. \nIt\u2019s a drink that refreshes , with a taste to savour. \nWe\u2019re sorry you\u2019re not a fan - that breaks our heart.\nPerhaps you and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar just got off to the wrong start?\nWe would love you to give it another shot, \nJust give us your address (we kid you not).\nWe\u2019ll send you some vouchers with the hope that this time\nYou and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar will be more than just fine!"
