We know sustainability, and recycling specifically, is a vital issue to address and that\u2019s why we\u2019re currently in the process of reviewing our sustainable packaging strategy which we will publish later in the year. Deposit return schemes have been a big part of these discussions as more people are looking for ways to increase recycling rates. So while our review is still ongoing, it\u2019s clear to us that the time is right to trial a well-designed deposit scheme for drinks containers, starting in Scotland where conversations are underway already. Thanks"

We have a new long-term target to see that all of our packaging recovered so that none ends up where it shouldn\u2019t. The first step is to double the amount of recycled plastic in our bottles to 50% by 2020. We\u2019ll also launch our biggest ever ad campaign to inspire more of our consumers to recycle and champion new ways to improve packaging recovery.
