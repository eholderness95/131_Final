        "message": "Why only 50% recycled plastic and why in 3 years time? Come on coca-cola, you are one of the largest drinks manufacturers in the world. You can do better than this! Why not lead by example! Here is an idea... Why not bring back Coca-Cola Life and use 100% recycled plastic, maybe have artwork of marine life on the label, market it as an environmentally responsible product and see sales soar. I think you are underestimating what consumers want and I for one am a typical consumer who is now looking to drastically cut back on plastic use and it would be a shame to stop buying coca-cola because I love it!"

Long term, we would like to use more recycled PET in all of our bottles, which is why as part of our strategy we will be seeking reform of the recycling system in the UK to improve recovery and recycling rates. \nFor more info, please visit: www.coca-cola.co.uk/sustainablepackaging  http://spr.ly/61808Shxq"

However, we recognise that as a global company that operates around the world, we have a role to play in helping address the problem in other countries too. There is no one-size-fits -all solution for the countries we operate in. Solutions to such a vast environmental challenge require collaboration across industries, NGOs, governments, and communities. We agree that action is needed, are open to doing more and to working with others to create long-term, effective solutions."
