        "message": "Tired of seeing so many Coke bottles littered all over the place. I am glad you are now targeting 40% recycled materials but why not 100%? I couldn't care less if my bottle isn't transparent. What I do care about is the fact our oceans are full of plastic - much of it yours. You should use 100% recycled plastic or plant based materials. I have stopped buying your plastic bottles and won't until they are environmentally friendly."
