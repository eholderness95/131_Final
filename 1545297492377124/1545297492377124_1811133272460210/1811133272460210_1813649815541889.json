I for one enjoy the new improved Coke Zero and if it means that I die 5 years earlier than others than so be it - at least I got to live my life enjoying the things I like. There is no concrete info on the long term effects on health as sweeteners such as those used by Coca Cola haven't been around long enough for long term study. Teeth rot? Crisps/Chips are worse. Obesity? Only by the ignorant and stupid who think having a Diet drink instead of full sugar enables them to have extra elsewhere. Enjoy Zero :D"
