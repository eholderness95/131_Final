Have you thought about perhaps producing biodegradable bottles, made out of plants or something less destructive to the marine environment."

            "message": "Hi Evie, thanks for getting in touch. We\u2019ve already been using renewable packaging innovations for many years, like the PlantBottle. The first fully recyclable plastic bottle made partly with a special plastic which comes from plant material, which means we don\u2019t have to use as much petroleum-based plastic. We\u2019re also proud to say that all of our bottles and cans in Great Britain are 100% recyclable and have been since 2012. This means that all our drinks packaging can be recycled at home or when you\u2019re out and about. We have embarked on a major review of our sustainable packaging strategy to understand what role we can play to unlock the full potential of a circular economy.

            "message": "The thing is although your bottles re 100% recyclable, they are still found on beaches, in the sea, in parks, people are not recycling them, perhaps there needs to be more incentive, what about a deposit bank where you can get a discount off your next bottle.  There are lots of ideas about how to stop your bottles littering our environment.  I am sure you can come up with a better idea than single use bottles?"
