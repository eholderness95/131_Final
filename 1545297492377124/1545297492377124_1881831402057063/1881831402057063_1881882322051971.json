This means that all our drinks packaging can be recycled at home or when you\u2019re out and about. We recognise that sustainability, and recycling specifically, is an important issue and it\u2019s one that we care about deeply as a company. That\u2019s why we\u2019re currently in the process of reviewing our sustainable packaging strategy which we will publish in the summer. To keep up to date, please head to: www.coca-cola.co.uk/sustainability-section"

We know all that, what we want to know if exactly what are you going to do about your SINGLE use bottles and the fact that they are ending up in OUR environment. Have you thought that your consumers might want you to consider the environment a bit more? Have you considered a return scheme? Why dont you respond to people's concerns instead of just putting the same boring link up about sustainability and banging on about recycling - its not about that, its about single use. You guys need to stop thinking about the dollar and start thinking about people and the environment."

At the moment, at least 25% of the material in all of our bottles is recycled plastic, our aluminium cans contain around 42% recycled aluminium and there\u2019s 47% recycled glass in our glass bottles. And we want to go further: we\u2019re committed to increasing the amount of recycled and renewable material in our plastic bottles from 25% to 40% by 2020."

So while we review our sustainable packaging strategy, it\u2019s clear to us that the time is right to trial a well-designed deposit scheme for drinks containers, starting in Scotland these conversations are already underway."
