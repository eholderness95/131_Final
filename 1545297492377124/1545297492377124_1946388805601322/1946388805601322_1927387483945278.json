            "message": "Hi Pat, at this stage, our focus is on recovering all of our packaging so none of it ends up as litter or in the oceans. We\u2019ve worked with a number of experts and organisations to understand where we should focus our efforts. Plastic has lots of benefits and is fully recyclable. It\u2019s much lighter and uses less material than glass. It also can\u2019t get broken easily so it\u2019s safer. As long as it\u2019s responsibly disposed of, it can be recycled and reused into other packaging or fibre. Moreover, we\u2019re committed to supporting any well-designed initiative that could improve recovering and recycling rates, including a deposit return scheme. Ultimately that decision must be led by Government but requiring many organisations, \u2013 public and private \u2013 to work in partnership."
