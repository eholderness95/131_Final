        "message": "Why the hell is coca cola so special at Xmas!? It rots your guts, contains cancer causing additives or enough sugar to rot your kids teeth and make them fat! Fabulous.  Sorry to be a kill joy, but this international multi billionaire company doesn't have anything to do with Christmas. It has a lot more to do with money making and polluting our ocean with its massive amounts of plastic waste. Up your total of recycled plastic in your bottles Coca Cola to at least 70% and I'll think Xmas has come."
