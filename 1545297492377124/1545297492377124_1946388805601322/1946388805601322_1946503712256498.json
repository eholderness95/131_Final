I can understand how it is seductive and hypnotic and that\u2019s its intention. God forbid it goes and makes people go out and buy Coca-Cola. Capitalism is not positive for society it creates greed and poverty.  One of the reasons our MP\u2019s are Corporate Servants and Public Servants and are shafting anyone not a CEO or very very rich.\nUnfortunately, their target audience are susceptible to being told what to do, what to think, whatt to wear, what to eat and are not really encouraged to questions things."
