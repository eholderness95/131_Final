            "message": "Hi Sarah, at this stage, our focus is on recovering all of our packaging so none of it ends up as litter or in the oceans. However, we\u2019re working hard to ensure our packaging is as sustainable as possible. That\u2019s why as part of our strategy we will be seeking reform of the recycling system in the UK to improve recovery and recycling rates. We are continually evolving our recycling strategy and investing in innovations to support our overall sustainability commitments. For more, read here: http://spr.ly/6180D6oga"
