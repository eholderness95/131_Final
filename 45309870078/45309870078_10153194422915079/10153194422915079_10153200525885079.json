Marshall you may Tripp over them and not even know it,    I have been single for two years!!!   And I like It.  It does  have it plus side...    But it also nice to have someone you can come home to and that you can trust as well.   No feeling in the world like it.    The first guy I was engaged to him,  he decided  to sleep with my best friend...    It took  along time not to carry over the mistakes from the previous relationship...Once you learn to know longer do that,   And stop doing that, then you are totally free,   To Trust and To Love...  She/He including my self but I came to terms with that a long time ago...    Noting ventured noting gained,   Nothing  last forever,   even pain...   It would have to be special  person in my book,   Before I ever Complicated going out with any one for that matter...    But if our stars,  were wright we might meet at the same time with out business...    Once you are in a relationship that you can trust someone,   you will never be the same...    God Bless you  Marshall.   \u2764\ufe0f"

The people are already calling them Kings and Queens and love them more then our congressmen! I just do not want them becoming Tyrants its why i attacked there character! I need them to understand that a King and Queen only have 1 Castle and the majority of there wealth is to be used to take care of there people and to construct communities and city's within there state!....These stars manage money better then the Government does...they can collect the taxes...Eminem happens to be the smartest one in there bunch! So I would make him KING AS WE MOVE TOWARDS NEW WORLD ORDER! ASGARD CITY'S OF GOLD! HAVE FAITH IN EMINEM AND IN THE STARS THEY CAN DO THIS! START ORGANIZING! I WANT THE ARMY ON OUR SIDE NOT THERE'S! TIME TO BRING DOWN CONGRESS'S TYRANNY! SPREAD THE WORD! WERE TIRED OF CONGRESSES BULLSHIT!
