        "message": "I feel like the game has been weak recently, this is an odd request but if your  really a rap god you'll diss every single rapper who every claimed to be great, you might lose fans but you also might gain respect either way, nowa days people make the term 'hate' so ambiguous so even if your called a hater at the end of the day it matters whether they come back or not, if they don't you truly are a rap god, if they do strike them with the thunder of your lyricism"
