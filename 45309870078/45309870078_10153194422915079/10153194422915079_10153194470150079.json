The people are already calling them Kings and Queens and love them more then our congressmen! I just do not want them becoming Tyrants its why i attacked there character! I need them to understand that a King and Queen only have 1 Castle and the majority of there wealth is to be used to take care of there people and to construct communities and city's....These stars manage money better then the Government does...they can collect the taxes...Eminem happens to be the smartest one in there bunch! So I would make him KING AS WE MOVE TOWARDS NEW WORLD ORDER! ASGARD CITY'S OF GOLD! HAVE FAITH IN EMINEM AND IN THE STARS THEY CAN DO THIS! START ORGANIZING! I WANT THE ARMY ON OUR SIDE NOT THERE'S! TIME TO BRING DOWN CONGRESS'S TYRANNY! SPREAD THE WORD! WERE TIRED OF CONGRESSES BULLSHIT!\n\nIM SKITTLES TASTE THE RAINBOW BITCHES"
