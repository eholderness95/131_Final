        "message": "Hip hop needs more of these kinds of tracks.  Wish he would've filled the V disc with work like this instead of a bunch of radio singles that got played out and weren't that good to begin with...\n\nEdit: He even says he'd rather make \"Not Afraid 2\" than another \"We Made You\" and then fills the classic disc with stuff like \"Purple Pills\" and \"Wanksta\"... SMH... I wish the label would get off his ass and he could just do some real shit for the true fans."
