It's cool when it's extremely technical of course, but that's not an absolute importance. Point is rap, being music as well, is not a competition as a lot of people seem to think."

It's part of the game, that's why some artists beef with each other sometimes and rappers always say they're better than others. In Hip-Hop, competition is necessary because it's a rebellious youthful and it's combat music. And even if there was no competition, we as fans and listeners, can still say ''I prefer this one, or this one'' and argue by pointing facts."
