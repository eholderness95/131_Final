All I ever see flooded in the comment section is \"#RapGod\", best rapper ever, lil wayne should work at McDonalds, some shitty sketch drawing with Eminem or his name, \"Like if you've seen this movie (8 Mile)\". FUCK OFF. You don't know shit about Eminem let alone rap. If you're going to state stuff like this then listen to the best and biggest (Nas, Biggie etc.) and then voice your opinion. But in the meanwhile shut the fuck up. The majority of you people probably don't know who Proof is and listen to these new shitty songs he creates like Not Afraid. Listen to the Marshall Mathers LP because that was arguably one of the best albums ever."
