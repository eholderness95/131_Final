Also,I agree that Eminem has taken some humor out of his music but you have to remember that with his last 2 albums (Recovery,MMLP2) he was in his 30\u2019s and turned 40. He\u2019s an older and seemingly more mature man now so the humor he used to incorporate might not be something he wants to have in his music anymore."

Beautiful Pain,Headlights,Legacy,and Stronger Than I Was are meaningful and deeper songs from MMLP2 (you could probably throw Bad Guy in there too) and the majority of Recovery had meaningful songs. 25 To Life,Going Through Changes,Space Bound,Talkin\u2019 To Myself,I could go on. Even the up tempo/hit songs on the albums like The Monster and Not Afraid are meaningful if you really look at the lyrics."
