        "message": "You can follow some rules. Follow the law. To some extent follow the rules at the work place. But outside the workplace whose life is it? Why should a 3rd party be allowed to make rules for your life. There are some who don't want the responsibility of choosing their own values and rules to live by and are comfortable having the pact or group make them for them. That's fine. But to the brave souls that choose freedom and have to making their own rules to live by and be totally responsible for themselves, the rules don't apply."
