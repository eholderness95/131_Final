        "message": "PLEASE READ !!! To whom ever reads this.. If you do .  My son was 7 years old , I bought him your first  CD.. Little did I know at the time , ops how much bad language there was.. oh well.. I was a fan. So I wanted to listen as well. This was 20 years ago.  He till this day, lives an dies by your music.  My dream was to take him to a show, but you don't tour Canada as much.   Can't really afford to travel to the US . So my question is.. Will you come to Canada soon ? I'm in the Ottawa area.  Our Capital.  \nPlease.  I was a single mom , I had my son at 13 , life was hard, but we did it. An he's an amazing son.  I'm proud of him.  My only dream was to take him to one of your shows.  We've helped each other along the way.  This is the least I can do for him. Hoping to reach out for an answer .. Thank you so much.  Sorry to bug you. \nRachel"
