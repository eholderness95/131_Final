However if they go to a hospital for treatment,  it is illegal for the hospital to turn them away.Then the odds of them actually paying the thousands of dollars in hospital bills is very low. So yes I guess they do get health coverage. Then they come here demanding citizenship.  Tell me in what other country in the world you can be an illegal and demand the government to give you rights. None only america. "
