        "message": "Hell The Sequel kicked every rapper in the ballz man you guys slayed that shit. I gotta say Royce did better than Em on some of those. And I mean that in the best way possible. B/c Em is by far not only one of the greatest rappers/MC's of all time, he's one of the greatest lyricists of all time. I easily put him up there with Bob Dylan and John Lennon and Carly Simon and Stevie Nicks and all them oldies to newbies. Just fantastic man. Anybody who knocks you don't listen to them b/c they're just jealous they can't spit a rhyme like you man. Seriously. Keep delivering that dope shit till you die."
