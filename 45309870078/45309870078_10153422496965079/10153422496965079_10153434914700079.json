        "message": "The thing is rap is not just rap anymore, Hip Hop is part of the modern music culture,but some people believe its just about rapping a few good bars and you're in, or having beefs, or gangs and gun violence,nope nope. Hip Hop is part of the main music culture. With music its comes with all sorts ot learning,Composition, arrangements, mixing and mastering. The right Bpm, the right tempo,melody,clarity, pitch, sound modulaton, Fm synthesis,Trap beats and I can go on and on,so if you want to be a good Hip Hop artist then you have to take time and study music, staying away from every negative influences."
