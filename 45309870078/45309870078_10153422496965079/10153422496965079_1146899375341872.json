        "message": "Yo, just want to say I'm not just some fan trying to ride your coattail. I'm a genuinely talented bassist, and I feel I could bring a lot to the table as far as your music is concerned. I'm doing my own thing now, with a band called Bear The Whips. Considering you're my #1 inspiration, you could say you've inspired B.T.W. too (at least the bass playing/melodies I'm writing). As soon as we've got some professional sounding recordings, I'll send you a link. In the meantime call me, I can hook you up with some bass lines using my apogee jam (allows me to send bass lines via text, email, whatever you want). I just want the chance to show you what I can do. Working for you would literally be my dream job. (561)374-4454. I'm located in West Los Angeles."
