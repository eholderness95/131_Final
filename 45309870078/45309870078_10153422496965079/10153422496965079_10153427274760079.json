When she needed you most you were becoming the world's dream..fufilling their fantasy and your ego. ..rising with the self proclaimed ill princess...Where was the queen??? Undefined and proving the whole world is wrong...didn't they once tell her,\"so they won't know..\" yet she knows....will no1 discover who I am? Not even you ?? I once heard you speak of proving them all wrong... Or will you sit on your thrown as I remain hidden in the most humble of places again call out to you. Even your name speaks of the loneliest singular position."
