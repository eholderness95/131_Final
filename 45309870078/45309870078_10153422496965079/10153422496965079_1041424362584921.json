        "message": "Hey Em, it's me again. I just want to say that I am your biggest fan. Been on the bandwagon since day 1 when My Name Is first hit the airwaves. My mom had issues very similar to Debbie. My girl (who I had a kid with at 17) sometimes reminds me of your lyrics about women too. I have been playing bass since I was 12.  I'm 30 now, and I've been playing professionally for the past 8 years with various artists. I would absolutely LOVE to be your bassist. I have a lot to offer, and you're my favorite artist alive today. Please call me 561-374-4454. I look forward to hearing from you Em. Sincerely, your biggest fan."
