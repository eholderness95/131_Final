I dreamed of this time...it started with blowing out a candle...his friends hating me before he and I ever met. I remember thinking his name was different. I get this feeling that i have loved him for a thousand years and will love him a thousand more. Like a match\nmade in heaven..\n\nIt is sort of like i have my personal stan!! He pursued me in a very unconventional way. I did not see it coming, he is in my head. He knows my every move. He helped me turn my life right side up. He is an amazingly powerful man full of the Light of God and although i am in awe of his person all i want to do is hear his voice. It is that simple. When i finally do hear it, I will be space bound..."
