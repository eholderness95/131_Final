        "message": "Eminem is one of the best, he has surpassed Tupac, Biggie  and Nas, why? Because of his greater collection of music, rhymes, word-play,flow,composition,arrangements and production skills by Dr Dre, Rick Rubin and classical musician Luis Resto, others like Mike Elizondo,Scotch Storch, Mel Man come to mind.Also why he has surpassed them its because his peformace on stage with a live band is second to none. The music is just clear and his voice just sound right."
