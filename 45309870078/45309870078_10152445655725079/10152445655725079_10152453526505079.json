But at least I know how to really love someone and respect them!!!!!! You people have NO IDEA what great things you have that you are wasting.... not until it's gone!!!!!!!!!! And what's worse is I don't even know why you'd wanna cheat on someone you love anyway. I mean, isn't that why we call it \"love\"? Idk maybe I'm the fuckin retard here! I mean, after all, I've been single my whole life, so what would I know about relationships? Lol."
