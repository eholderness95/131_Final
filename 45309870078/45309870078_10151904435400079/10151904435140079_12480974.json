        "message": "Been listening to Em since 98'. I was 13. I had no idea then how much of an impact he would have on my life. Been a writer since the age of 7(writing stories and drawing comics), but Em was the first artist that showed one could rap about their actual life and make it. No guns, booty shakin bitches or money-glorifying songs. My inspiration was complete. I grabbed the mic."
