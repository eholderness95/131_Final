        "message": "My name is Mrs. Loosli and I teach at a at risk school is Las Vegas, Nevada. I have a student that everyone refers to as \"slim shaddy\" and he is on the brink of changing his life. His life aspirations include pursuing his rap music (he wrote a rap for our class that I would like Eminem to see) and he truly idolizes Eminem. I am trying to get in contact with Eminem to get some encouragement and support for this student to continue on the right path.His life would be FOREVER changed if there was any contact with his idol. It has changed my life seeing this student go from almost dying from overdose earlier this school year to being the Student of the Month in my classroom, and  I'm not sure how to get in contact but I am going to keep trying to be creative to make it happen."
