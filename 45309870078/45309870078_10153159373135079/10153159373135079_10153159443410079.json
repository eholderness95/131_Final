        "message": "For everyone commenting on his skin color... Let's ask the same question for black artist... You ask... \"If Em was black would he be as big of an artist as he is now?!\" My question is, if Young Thug or any black rapper was white would they even be taken seriously or have a career in music?! And I mean EVERYONE... PAC and BiG too, sure they'd have a career but the impact wouldn't be shit compared to what it is now... If they were white they would never be who they are now... Think before you play that card... Because if the roles were reversed he'd still be a dominant artist and even with half his fan base gone the other artist would never survive the criticism lol... I mean, I bet if Slim Jesus was black he'd be in everyone's iPods like some bullshit ass rappers are now... Complexity should have nothing to do with art... I know Young Thug and Gucci Mane would not be here if they were white... And if you sit here and disagree you need to be slapped into another dimension..."
