I want to save you girl, come be in Shady's world. \"Ooh boy you drive me crazy,\" bitch you make me hurl...\"\n\nBehold, I have brought low the corrupt synagogues of the doctrines of devils; ye are made a mark of shame and art blemished. \nHerein, ye are condemned and ye are unclean in your lusts and apothecaries of which is now cast into the pit. Begotten of the Devil, in all powers exercised of that mighty, yet fallen angel, Azazel. You are truly the precursor of your own impious actions. Amen and amen.\n\nGod bless you all and amen (so be it),\nNolan R. Wilson; Wondrous Counselor\nhttp://www.facebook.com/WondrousCounselor"
