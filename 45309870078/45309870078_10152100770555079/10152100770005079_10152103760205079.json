I've been clean from dope for four years now and every cd every fuckin song lyric kept me going. I listen to u everyday and everyday I struggle n I tel myself \"lindsay stop being a fuck pussbag n man up\" I throw on headphones and I may stumble but I won't crumble.  Thank you eminem from the bottom of my heart thank you."
