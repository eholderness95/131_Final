        "message": "To say best rapper alive is an understatement ... Especially when U have \"alive\" rappers in this day and age ... garbage rappers like lil Wayne and Ricky rosey ... I wonder if he is even better than biggie ... He for sure is better than Tupac ... He is already top 3 amongs all rappers but if he died tomorrow everyone would say he was the best rapper period... Also many black people have a hard time admitting that a white boy is the best at their \"culture\" ... Bc hip hop is viewed as a part of African American culture"
