        "message": "I love this side of Eminem. This is the kind of music we need. At the end of the day, we\u2019re all human. We all face the same problems, but deal with them differently. The best thing about Eminem is that he was never afraid to open up to the world about his life; something modern rap and hip-hop lacks. His music shows his humane side of him, and we can all relate. God Bless You Eminem. #RapGod."
