        "message": "I'm Christian; and I know Eminem is a Secular Rap Artist Compared to Christian Rap Artist Like \"Lecrea\"! \n\nBut I'm From Pontiac and Detriot; \nI represent Eminem \n\nWhile his music has profanity and sexual suggestiveness ...\n\n Their is always clean versions out their for his Christian/ Conservative Fans \n\nI think the Christians and Non Christians on here are profusely getting this Shirt and Meaning of it wrong ... \n\nEminem's Meaning of \"Rap God\" is exactly what it means \n\nIt doesn't mean \"Christian God\", it has no reference to it... \n\nBut Eminem does believe in God, he is A Catholic/ Christian Man, theirs a lot of people I know in my city who know him personally... \n\nHe's very different than the always-hardass-don't -fuck-with-me-persona ... \n\nI think instead of focusing on the God portion and putting to much emphasis on it; is what some of you Christias are getting  wrong .... \n\nYor being overly Critical ... \n\nRap God is specifically being. \"on top\", \"never been beaten\", \"superiority\" and \"Undefeated\"   \nOr Simply put \"Better\", than \n\n\"Other Rappers\" besides \"Eminem\" \n\nWhile their is no God superior to \"Jesus Christ\" \n\nThe meaning of Rap God is simply A Rap Artist superior over all other Rap Artist ... \n\nBasically \"A God\", of \"Rap Culture\", or \"Rapping Abilities\" \n\nGod- can have a double meaning \nIt's either the Christian meaning or Secular world meaning \n\nEminem is using it in Secular termanology, he's also not saying he's superior over the One True King ... This is a misinterpretation...."

Apparently I'm not aloud to give my opinion or personal views as a Christian or Individual. \n\nI'm two people away from meeting and knowing Eminem on a personal level. I have many people I know that grew up with Eminem or worked with him. That I'm friends with. I also have friends that have family and church related individuals that know Eminem on a personal level. \n\nI have general idea of how Eminem thinks between his personal relationships and public personality and music. \nThat's not to say he's perfect, that's not saying I know 'everything' about him, of course not, and I don't. \n\nI'm not stupid thanks, I'm not promoting anything thanks, and no my God is real. Sorry you don't see that. Sorry you don't 'know him'. That's not what I was here for to discuss. \n\nHowever, the comments on here are just complete disrespectful. I don't know how hard it is for people to be nice, or express their opinion that doesn't come from a bias but hate filled response. \n\nThis comment is from so far long ago. I don't know why I'm getting notifications on it now or still. Although, each to their own. I have every right to give my take on something that is public and can be observed from a moral or immoral perspective. \n\nI'm so very far from confused too. If anyone still wants to have a civilized adult conversation. I'll be waiting. ;)"
