for the moon sinceMC's get taken to school with this musicCause I use it as a vehicle tobust a rhymeNow I lead a new school full of studentsMe, I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N--W.A, Cube, Hey Doc, Ren Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got SlimInspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a positionTo meet Run DMC, induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'Roll Hall of FameEven though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flamesOnly Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fameOn the wall of shameYou fags think it's all a game'til I walk a flock of flamesOff a plank, andtell me what in the fuck are you thinkingLittle gay lookin' boySo gay I can barely say it with a straight face lookin', boyYou witnessing a massacreLike you watching a church gathering

then I'm reloading immediately with these bombsI'm totin'And I should not be wokenI'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floatingBut I got your mom deep throatingI'm out my ramen noodle,we have nothing in common, poodleI'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage,pupilIt's me, my honesty's brutalBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do thoughFor good at least once in a whileSo I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodleEnough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough timesBut I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsignedRappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtimeI know there was a time where once I Was king of the undergroundBut I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grindSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combineAppeal with the skin color of mineYou get too big and here they come trying to censor youLike that one line I said on \"I'm Back\" from the Mathers LP1Where I tried to say I take seven kids from ColumbinePut em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nineSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I wasBut I'm morphin' into an immortal coming through the portalYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004 thoughAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme forYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrowsYou write normal, fuck being normalAnd I just bought a new ray gun from the futureTo just come and shoot yalike when Fabolous made Ray J madCause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather\u2019s padSingin' to a man while they played pianoMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channelSo Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next dayHey Fab, I'mma kill youLyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaayou assuming I'm a humanWhat I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhumanInnovativeand I'm made of rubberSo that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to youI'm devastating, more than ever demonstratingHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitatingNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waitingFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebratingCause I know the way to get 'em motivatedI make elevating music,you make elevator musicOh, he's too mainstreamWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse itIt's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse itWith rock,shock rap withDocThrow on Lose Yourselfand make 'em lose itI don't know how to make songs like thatI don't know what words to useLet me know when it occurs to youWhile I\u2019m ripping any one of these verses, that versus youIt\u2019s curtains, I\u2019m inadvertently hurtin' youHow many verses I gotta murder to proveThat if you were half as nice at songs, you can sacrifice virgins tooSchool flunkie,pill junkyBut look at the accolades these skills brung meFull of myself, but still hungryI bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind toAnd I'm a million leagues above you,ill when I speak in tonguesBut it's still tongue in cheek,fuck youI'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel,I'm asleep in the front seatBumpin' Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky but funkyBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and strugglingAngels fight with devils and here's what they want from meThey're asking me to eliminate some of the women hateBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I hadThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situationAnd understand the discriminationBut fuck it, life's handin' you lemons, make lemonade thenBut if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake thenDon't mistake him for SatanIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseasAnd take a vacation to trip abroadAnd make her fall on her face and don't be a retardBe a king, think not - why be a king when you can be a God"
