Now he's matured in music industry and is a bit calmer y'all saying he's wack and they need the old eminem. His music is always impressive. There is a story/meaning behind his music. Its not like the normal Lil Wayne Krazy. I'll forever be an Eminem fan. TOO LATE TO START OVER"

I say a comment about people he made and if you treat him nice, he will treat you nice.  Isn't that what it's all about.  What I also like about MM is that, \"what you see is what you get.\"  He isn't phony.  He has made mistakes, who hasn't, but he has risen above them.  I'm going to admit, when he first started out, I didn't care much for him.  I'm glad those feelings have changed."
