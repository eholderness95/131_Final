Your music ... and the way you carried yourself along with the determination you have, enlightened her be herself which is a great person, in my eyes. She is a Doctor and has traveled to many countries and is an amazing lady. It is great to watch her listen to HER music and see that strength for your words as well as other artist embody her and allow her to reconnect with the person she is and not just the person they want her to be. So, thank you for just being.. a mom and fan forever :)"
