When I'm mad I listen to you. Sad? Play some Em. Happy? Play some Em. Any emotion just play some Marshall Mathers ! I swear you are the reason I'm still here sounds crazy but you give me hope. A lot of it. The little but I need to not do something I would regret. God bless you you are amazing and you deserve the life you have."
