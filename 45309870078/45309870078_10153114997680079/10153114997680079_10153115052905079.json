He was able to flow to the beat like nobody has ever done before or since and that fat bastard was smooth with it and hard as hell when he wanted to be.He was a great story teller in his rhymes, complete with characters and all.Remember ,\"darkskin Jamaine\" lol..Now Em is a genius with lyrics and has an extisive vocabulary and able to bend words to make it rhyme even when it doesnt even rhyme. He spits venom with his lyrics and is a wordsmith and can mix match words and put them together better than any rapper ever has...He is truly a mad scientist of rap and can flo any style so he is also unique in that way.Plus he is a great producer..They r all three great in their own.way...I can also appreciate other rappers like Jay-Z, Royce 5'9 is really dope, Jada,Rahkim, Talib Qwali, NAS,DMX, Yelawolf, Joe Budden, Ghostface, Method man....and many more....And some kind of unknown cats like Blind Fury.....Its alot of great rappers out there man...But Em, Biggie,& Pac r my top 3."
