        "message": "It's hard to believe it's almost been 20 years since I heard the song \" Dear Moma\" and it still brings a tear to my eye when you hear him say \"you are appreciated\". I think the reason that Tupac resonates with so many people is because he lived the life he sang about, just like Eminem. Whether it was Tupac in LA, or Eminem in Detroit, their songs are real because they lived it."
