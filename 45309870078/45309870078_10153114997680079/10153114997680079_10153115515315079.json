        "message": "Nice to reed a tribute to what I think is the best lyrical genius who graced this earth, but someone who was completely misunderstood. If people bothered to listen to all of 2pac's lyrics, they would see a highly talented individual that was just telling a story, yes controversial but a voice for the people, my favourite lyrics from 2pac were not even on one his song but a intro to his best album Me Against the World \" A coward dies a thousand deaths a soldier dies but once\", when I first heard some off your tunes I said to myself this guy has studied some of 2pacs ways and made his own, there's been no one since Tupac but your pretty close"
