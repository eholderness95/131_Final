Accepting Jesus Christ (and eternal life) is as simple as repeating this prayer. Once you've read it, give it a thumbs up. | | | Heavenly Father, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I confess that you are my lord and savior. I know and believe that you died on the cross for me, and rose again three days later. Thank you for saving me, healing me, and making my life brand new at this very moment. In Jesus name, amen!"
