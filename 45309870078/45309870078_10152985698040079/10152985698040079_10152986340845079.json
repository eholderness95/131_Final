Babies are grown from small number of cells on the other hand so aberrant cells already interfer with development.\n\nThis cycle in case of a person where it would work for rejuvination would probably have to be done on an optimal mass range, considering organs possibly could have a maximum size a lesser multiply of the basal size of organs compared to the multiply of maximum muscle size compared to basal muscle size, While also organs could stop in growth earlier then musculature, considering abdominal muscles would restrain organs in growth somewhat.\n\nOther methods maybe organs taken outside of the body, combined with some samples perhaps from other tissues of other animals or tissues of some human embrioes grown in an ex vivo womb (while the brain is not yet developed), then via experiments creating recombined tissues wich grow larger then normally but still functional as the other tissue or for secretions of different ammounts of molecules, so possible to use to implant parts of these externally grown tissues in place of old tissues of organs or so, or used for growing organs outside of the body where molecular signals are more essential.\n\nThe externally grown tissues could be even stretched or have fine/neat cuts introduced to fascilitate scarless healing, thus possible rejuvination of tissues, with this approach also.\n\nAlso possibly removing some body mass sewing people together then one organ set may nurture 2-3 persons , while the other organs are given to such sewn together old persons.\n\n(have to note maybe without external tissue recombination manipulation there could be a need for steady birth of women at least to have always fresh ovaries).\n\nthere is also a North Korean developed drug named Kumdang-2 wich possibly helps dedifferentiate some stemcells and stimulate rejuvination in tissues while also interfering with a number of infective agents.\n\nI was conspierd against most of my life, probably starting at childhood my headshape was realised to lead to such person who unbothered would discover such simple engineering solutions/possibilities to life extention, so the criminals have manipulated me [via psychology as well as probably some injections to cause assimmetric development of body or whatnot.. plus a number of things otherwise], therefore i have realised my lack of resources (comparable less good living environment from very young life onward realising i couldnt meet social needs, while realising robots are possible to make, but the hardware produced by industrial complexes is a vast ammount, so having noted a number of horrible things, i mostly was reserved and shy not much conversing with others either, then i was mostly considering video games or playing video games of some sorts.\n\n(realy fighter robots of simple sort are quite simple.. so it is primarily about who or wich group or tribe has the better usually bigger robotic army.. or more lucky in chosing targets in case of a multyscene battle while having sufficiently large size in comparision of another armies size and geometric arrangements.)"
