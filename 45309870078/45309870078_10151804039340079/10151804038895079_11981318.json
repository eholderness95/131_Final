        "message": "Everyone seems to believe that the Eminem at the very end is in reference to Slim Shady. I don't believe that to be true. In Inception, the elevator doesn't move down in terms of chronological order. The things we hold most dear to us are at the bottom of the elevator, hidden and safe kept from the world.  I believe the last Eminem is a reference to \"Love the way you Lie\"...and the papers he throws out aren't the past Em giving Em raps for the future, but yet love letters.....from Kim."
