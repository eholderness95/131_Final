        "message": "Like the video. Eminem is truly one of the greatest rapper alive and ever. He's right their behind 2Pac. I don't care what anybody says. He really is the rap god and he can back up that title too. Eminem is a rapper unlike any other. He's got his own twisted flow and twisted style, but that's what makes him really good. I can listen to Eminem all day and never get tire of his music. He's the greatest, the best, and a LEGEND. He's untouchable and nobody can beat him."
