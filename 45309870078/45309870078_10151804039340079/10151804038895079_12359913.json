        "message": "Hey!  Living in rural Alaska, where heroin & meth is taking over.  My community has started an Reclaim Alaska group to take our town back.  I myself am in recovery, I've written up a speech to share with the youth of our town.  The Reclaim Alaska has made statewide news.  I'd like to use the intro to Not Afraid to conclude my speech.  Email; leftykat@hotmail.com or msg on here.  My efforts to get our towns children, teenagers, and adults to either abstain from drugs or get the courage the stop and get our rural native village back to what it was prior to the drugs, anything that you and yours can do to aid in this movement will come back in ten-fold!  Thank you!"
