Well listen to this! Yeshua is Jesus in Hebrew \u2013 [Yod, Shin, Vav, Ayin] (Sorry I can\u2019t embed the Hebrew letters) The name of Jesus in Hebrew is pronounced Yeshua which means Salvation but there is much more to it. Every letter in Hebrew has multiple meanings, so when the letters are combined to make a word, not only does it have the meaning of the word itself, but has the combined meaning of the letters that comprise the word. When we read letter by letter from right to left, as Hebrew is supposed to be read, this is what happens: \u2022 Yod: has a numerical value of 10 and its meanings include: Work, Hand /Arm, Activity, Deed. \u2022 Shin: has a numerical value of 300 and its meanings include: Destroy, Consume, Devour \u2022 Vav: has a numerical value of 6 and its meanings include: Join, Nail, Establish, Secure, Attach, Man\u2019s number \u2022 Ayin: has a numerical value of 70 and its meanings include: Eye, See, Understand This computes to mean: Yeshua \u2013 The hand that destroys the establishment of the eye 300+10+70+6= 386. 3+8+6=17 hebrew meaning of #17 equals victory! Illuminati is dead where they stand. Repent and accept Jesus Christ."

He does not rely on a bunch of hooks, he doesn't have 1 - 2 original lines and then repeat the same lyric over or sing incomprehensibly so the only words you recognize are bitch, ho, ass, Dom P champagne. No, he does not waste his time with that dishonest crap. He is a wordsmith, just like Beck or Wu Tang, (ok everyone have 1 sec to hate on Beck). His lyrics tell a story if you listen. His songs contain irony, sarcasm, black humor, grit  the stuff of real life lived hard and honest. I picture him writing lyrics and then adding a word, substituting another word, throwing out weak words and massaging words until he has just the right mix with the right sound. Eminem holds the Guinness world record for the greatest number of words in a single hit..his song, Rap God contains 1,560 words. I rest my case people."
