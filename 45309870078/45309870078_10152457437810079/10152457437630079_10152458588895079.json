        "message": "Bought the slim shady lp at hmv. Very dissapointed it didnt have the raw version of \"my name is\", despite the parental advisory badge. I remember a friend having the original album with the original version when i was like 10 years old, i just cant believe they dont sell the original version on disc anymore. Heart-breaking."
