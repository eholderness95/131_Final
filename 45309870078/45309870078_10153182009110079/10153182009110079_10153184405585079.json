        "message": "The war does not bring peace, I prefer to be humble and sometimes have to put up with an insult than cause sores on innocent people, only evolved can forgive, the weak always want to show their strength and it is no use it is rap, and is a idea to spread the peace is to avoid war, the real war should be against hunger and lack of humanity of people. inhumane words can not change the world but rap is made of words and has great power to try at least change- By me"
