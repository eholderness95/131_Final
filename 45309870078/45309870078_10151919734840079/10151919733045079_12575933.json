Epic Brilliance. Eminem is a true ARTist. HipHop is ART... SOUL... TRUE LIFE... and so much more....  Lil Wayne (and Drake, 2-Chains...etc...) Imbeciles. Posers..? Lil Wayne might say something witty every now and then but how hard is it to repeat yourself a million times, rhyme one syllable words, I mean get fn real. EMINEM is one of the very best, hands down. =]"
