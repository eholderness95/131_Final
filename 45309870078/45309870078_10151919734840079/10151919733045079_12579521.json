I've worked in the music industry, produced the Hip-Hop Honors Awards, hung with Snoop, Grand Master Flash, Kendrick, TI, Luda, The Game and the Wu and many many more.  From what I've learned through the years is, if you don't think Eminem is the real deal you're just ignorant and have no clue what real hip-hop is."
