        "message": "Jay Flores it sounds to me like he just wants to drop talented names, and make it out like Em's the reason they aren't relevant anymore. Eminem ain't for everybody. Black or white,  I've seen  the same number of people who hate him. Fine. Its when people act like he doesn't have any substance though.. that bugs me. Talking like they're the encyclopedia of \"real hip hop\"... meanwhile probably defend lil wayne. I know people are on wayne's dick.. but any sane person knows he has zero real substance. Same with drake. They appeal to one demographic while Em has probably one of the broadest and most versatile fan base. Fact. People like Terrence Sampson can't seem to differentiate having substance, and just not being able to PERSONALLY relate everything he says.  But what do I know,  I'm obviously just a heroin shooting red neck for supporting Slim lol"
