        "message": "I've been a fan of Eminem since he first started, I've been waiting for this album for the last three years and when I heard the album was going to be named 'Marshal Mathers LP 2' , I freaked out, I was so happy and I stayed up all night to hear this song. and honestly I'm disappointed. MM LP was a classic and this song is nothing like it, I sure hope the album is nothing like this. I love and always will love Eminem, at the end his shittiest tracks are better than 90% of the music out today."
