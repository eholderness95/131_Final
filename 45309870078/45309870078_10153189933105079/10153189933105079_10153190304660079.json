        "message": "ONE NIGHT STAND (from hell) \u00a9\nWind me up like your little toy doll ... \nStand me up , then watch me fall ...\nNever tell me how you feel .... \nNever holding me away from fear ...\nDo you see my silent tears when I give you a smile ... \nCan you tell my body aches when I haven't seen you in awhile ..\nSeems like you care when you are near .... \nHolding me across your chest ... hearing your every breath ... \nEvery heart beat ... so close to me ...\nI almost feel at home ... \nTill you're gone ...\nThen I find I am lost ... \nIn your cold hearted frost ... When you leave ... \nMe shivering ... in the mist of your empty presence ... \nEmpty ever-essence\nFeelings I don't want .. Yet can't dismiss ... \nYou give me more pain an' emptiness .. \nthan anything else ..\nLight a candle upon my shelf ...\nThe bruises have never healed ... \nThough they are not on my skin .. \nThey reside within ...\nI let you in to step all over the shattered pieces you keep leaving behind ... \nfragments left unseen ... \nMy hurt so unseen ...\nI open up and let you in ... \nYou cough me out like a disease ..\nGuilt trips can only take me so far ... \nEach one you hand me opens up an old scar.\nThat candle on the shelf flickers in the darkness ...\nTears rolling down my cheeks ....\nYou're....\nHEARTLESS..... HEARTLESS .... HEARTLESS ...\nI should care less ... LESS ... LESS ... LESS ...\nTo worn down to hear the lies ... to tired of the whys ....\nCan't say I never tried ...\nDo you ever think of me ... like I do you ... \nand cry at night ?\nDo you ever see that your wrongs haven't always been right ?\nIn your black dark heart ... does it see any light ?\nMr. RIGHT ... Mr. RIGHT .... Right.....RIGHT...\nI give and you take ...\nCan't collect what you haven't banked ...\nMaybe it's time you feel this heartache ...\nYou wrote a check your ass couldn't cash ..\nI want my money back ...\nBACK >..BACK.... BACK ...\nI lost my balance .. when you threw me off ... \nHard knock ... HARD KNOCKS...\nKnocked me out ...\nLooking up from the hard cold cold ground ..... I see you are not around ..\nNever was ... never will be ...\nShame on you ...\nNO... No...NOOOOOO....NOOOOOOO...\nShame on me ... \nFor letting you back in ...\nNever ... NEVER...NEVER NEVER EVER ... EVER... \nAGAIN...\nThey say love wins ... \nSo this is the end ...\nYou wouldn't know love if God gave it to you in your hand ... \nI can't be your lady when you don't even know how to be a man ...\nAn ''' an ''' Annnd.....AND.....\nYou were only a one night stand . ........\nAMEN ... .AMEN .... AMEN ... AMEN...\nTime to let go of our sins ...\nLast page turned ... \nThe story now ends.\nThe Devil's Angel\u00a9 Melanie Coleman \u00a9\n11/28/15"

Home\nChances are you can learn to cope .. \nLace a rope .. smoke some dope and ... cut a throat\nOr maybe you wont.. \nCope ...\nDeath / suicide could be the antidote ..\nSo grab the knife ... \nHear the kids ... \nThen think twice .\nPace the Kitchen ... as you realize ..\nGoing to prison isn't worth two black eyes ..\nYou start to cry then apologize ..\nKnife still in grip ... and as they hug you they still won't quit all the filthy guilt trips ... then the knife slips .. to the floor ...\nWords echo out the door ...\nMinutes later your back in the sack addicted to each others touch like rabid addicts who want more ... \nWon't stop , can't stop till .. \nThe sun hits the window sill ...\nThen it quiets to a still ...\nHolding each other like the night before didn't happen ... Both smiling and laughing .. \nSighing and kissing ...\nAs the sun starts glistening .. \nyou both start listening to each other's breaths .. \nas the violence now turns to a rest ..\nLying across each other's chests ...\nHow did our love get to this ..\nTo be continued ....\nThe Devil's Angel\u00a9 Melanie Coleman"
