        "message": "I like how people on here say that busta is better yet in the song calm down Eminem totally obliterates him in spitting.. And also Twista only has a couple songs to where you can even understand him and him and busta rap about the same stupid shit money and bitches and everyone on here should get their facts straight before hating. Em will woop both there asses in a freestyle and kills them in rap in general... As for tech n9ne he is equal with em both of them are rap gods no one could compare to either of them the way they rap is unreal so both of them would kill Twista and busta rhymes in anything and it is a proven fact"
