        "message": "The reason why eminem is a great rapper is because he talks about life problems. Other rappers like Tupac and Biggie used to talk about their life and that's what made them famous. Unfortunately nowadays most rappers like drake or lil Wayne would talk about some hooker they love or their fame."
