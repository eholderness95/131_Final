However, Hopsin, Tupac, and the king hailed by kings, Kendrick Lamar are on this list. Just disrespectful. As a rapper, yes, eminem is awesome. Yet he lacks content. His recycled lyrics are quite boring. Hearing the same harsh words and wordplay he used to get famous in his most recent work is nothing short of utterly disappointing and seeing him and his holistically repetitive single, might I add, praised in lieu of albums like \"To Pimp A Butterfly\" which was a \"ghetto lullaby\" that told a story featuring themes and variation, motifs and direction in each track, earning the title \"a lyrical landmark\" by Consequence of Sound, is appalling. In full, Em is an old dog doing old tricks who did said tricks in record time. Don't disrespect greats, gods, kings, and legends over tongue twisters, witty words, and fast talking- Twista and Busta are still around. The only thing that separates these two tongue tornados from Em is color and explicit language. Remember the truth in this hype. Again, Eminem is great, but is in no way, especially compared to the likes of Hopsin, Kendrick, Pac, and Jenkins, is a god. Lowercase g intentional."
