It\u2019s\ngoing to be Stout. \nAt the end of it, I\u2019ll probably plan a trip to go catch some Trout.\nMarshall Mathers, Can YOU Hear me? Are you out there?\nI\u2019m going to chase you down and and hunt you with my Care Bear. Stare. \nYou\u2019re probably over there, hiding in your lair. Thinking, \u201c Go\nAhead. If you Dare.\u201d\nPfffffftt. \nThis is gonna be rare. \nYep. As in, RAW. \nI beckon you with my finger, not even a claw. \nI have a bone to pick with you. \nFirst of all, props for killing off Slim. You needed to Trim. That fat. \nAs for making amends with your mom, I was praying for that. It was pretty bomb. \nListen, no doubt about it\nYour music is\u2026Fuck this Shit!\nYou suck and you need to get on\nwith it. \nAs in, Stop being a Nit-Wit. \nAs in, Ma Ake the world a better place. \nOtherwise, you are just a fucking Fa Ake. \nYep. I\u2019m on your case. \nI\u2019m literally looking for a trace. \nI see it in your handsome face. (Don\u2019t worry, I aint gonna go pick out\nany lace. )\nYou have it in you. Until I hear it, I won\u2019t know if you are true. Blue. \nI won\u2019t even let you be in my crew. \nAnd on that, you can stew. \nThat\u2019s your Cue. \nOh, that\u2019s right. Now that you\u2019ve\nmade the big League, \nAll we get is a bunch of Intrigue. \nLet me be Strait. Here is my\nIssue. Hold on a minute. Let me go get my Tissue. \nI\u2019ve been blowing snot, Wishing I was on a cot.\nYep. As in. Jail. In Japan. Praying for a Ban.\nI\u2019ve been wiping my tears. This\nhunting season, I\u2019ve seen my share of fears. \nYep. Taji. They kill dolphins and whales.\nSome bought and sold into\ncaptivity. All species and variety. \nLook it up and see the bloody coves. While we cooked at our Christmas Stoves. \nWhole pods killed or traumatized. It\u2019s this kind of shit that makes me know I can\u2019t be acclimatized. \nCome on, Man! Where are you?\nThose sea creatures are dead and locked in suffering, while you eat and\ncomplain about how you can\u2019t dine at McDonalds for all the throngs that are\nmonitoring. \nWhat?\nYou sounded like a spoiled Brat, and that aint Phat.\nYou need to get a clue, dude. \nDon\u2019t you care about your food?\nFollow the chain, use your brain. Don\u2019t be a stain. \nYou need to be on the Conscious Resistance Train!!"
