        "message": "The SSLP CD album was my first of Eminem. I was instantly hooked and been with him since. As the world turns was one of my faves, guilty conscience, and so many other awesome songs. I can relate to Em's music. He's not glorified by the light, he did what he needed to provide a life for him and Hailey and Alana."
