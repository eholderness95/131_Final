Your too smart for that. but then I look at myself, great family, home to call ours and I still am so messed up I wanna die daily. One day. wish I knew how you got through. I hear it in your music but with all the hurt and pain how did you keep going? Hope I find it soon. True fan. my kids as well. And I love them listening to you because you don't bullshit. tell it like it is and F..... the rest. love you man."
