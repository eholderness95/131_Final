        "message": "Yelawolf is weak. Eminem made a poor decision choosing between MGK and Yelawolf... \n\nMgk had roughly 2.7x the number of sales on his Lace up album than Yelawolf had on his first album (name slips my mind at the moment)\n\nIf we're talking money, which is what the world revolves around, then he made a poor decision."
