When Em came out he stated that the right side of the stage was going to be his and I was on the left side. Never got a good view of him and pics and video suck, the sound was horrible! I will never go to another Em show again. I loved him and he didn't even bother to come over to my side at all. $242 + gas (drove 800 miles total there and back same day) + tolls + parking. The only good thing about it was I went with my best friend and on the way in we got 2 shirts for $15 each and I got to be home for the night!"
