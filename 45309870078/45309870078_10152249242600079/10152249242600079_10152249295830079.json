Your best bet would be to ask for Mr. Porter to accompany him, though I doubt he sits on facebook all day. Get creative, maybe, and print some crazy stuff on the face of an envelope...send a letter to his residence in New York. I doubt his concerts are overtly violent with pits - maybe back in the day -, so you could wait until he tours the U.S again. At least see him in person from afar."

I'm sure your son would still be very excited."
