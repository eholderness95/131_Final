        "message": "Don't buy any of these clothes!  I'm sad to say that I ordered the Rap God t-shirt back on Black Friday for my 12yr old for an awesome Christmas present and when I received it I was so very disappointed! You can hardly see the words at all! It looks NOTHING like the picture I saw on here that was nice and bright. I emailed customer service about it 2 weeks ago and I've yet to hear anything! Apparently since Eminem doesn't struggle anymore financially, the $32 it cost this struggling single Mama, doesn't mean much to him or his staff who takes care of his business. Thanks Eminem, this was supposed to be one of my Jaden's super cool presents since it was a one time offered shirt and hard to get! I used to really like and respect you, not so much anymore  :-("
