        "message": "Drake  Hahahaha!!  Please, he's not even strong enough to carry your crown.  You're the greatest artist in what you do so here's an idea.  When you come up with a new album, do a track with Marilyn Manson.  I'm 100 percent positive he'll be up for it.  I'm tired of all the music sounding the same.  You have your own unique style, \"Drop the Bomb on 'Em.\"  Also, \"King,\" I really, really want to hear another Ken Kaniff skit.  He's been on a break  Hahahahaha!!  Do it!!"
