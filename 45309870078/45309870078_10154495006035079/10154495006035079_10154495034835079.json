But Dimitri, why are you talking about verses? I'm talking about music, songs and albums.. Everybody can make a dope verse, but only a few artists can make big and amazing concept albums. Lin-Manuel changed the game with Hamilton. He took rap and forced it to evolve. Rap has been dying since the late 90s. Without Lin-Manuel rap would have completely died off in a decade."

Wow, like how did you get all that great knowledge about the evolution of hip hop?\n\nYes, I'm being very ironic if your small brain didn't get that. Listen, I'm actually making some valid arguments here for why Lin-Manuel is helping rap evolve, and all the OG rappers on his mixtape also see it. But you're right dude, I guess you know better than Joell Ortiz, Busta Rhymes and all those other rap veterans, right? smh"
