        "message": "The Eminem Show is by far my favourite album and in my opinion Eminem's best album. But that t-shirt is just stupid man... Fugly as hell. I mean, a tv with the no service screen with the eminem show written over it? That's just lame and ugly and so not creative. It's the complete oposite of what the album is. Come on man, you guys can do better than this! That Shady ltd. clothing was the illest back in 2000's! The shirts were better, pants were baggier which is better! Come on, where's the HipHop at?! You should bring back that Shady ltd. Styles and designs from those days! When HipHop was still HipHop and no rappers in skinny jeans, leggings or UGGs! Okay, I'm drifting off... Peace! \u270c\ud83c\udffb\ufe0f"
