OVER AND OVER AND OVER!  While contemplating on seeking out the loudest mouth in the theater and then distracting them by dumping a large diet Coke on their head, and when they've been blinded by the Splenda of it all, I'm going to SMASH THEIR FACE FOR DISRUPTING THE MOVIE!\n\nSorry for the brief outburst.  I was having a \"moment\".\n\nSincerely,\n\nA concerned citizen of Detroit.   <3\n\nP.S.  Do you happen to know if the people running the Beats App can see how many times a user has listened to a single song?  Can they see if it's been listened to OVER AND OVER AND OVER again?  If so, this is really embarrassing.  Embarrassing, not for me, but for a friend on a three day song bender, who just happens to be using my cell phone....  ;-)"
