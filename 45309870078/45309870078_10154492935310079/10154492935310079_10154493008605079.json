        "message": "That's the album that got me into listening to Eminem. Way back in my childhood, I asked my buddy for his copy of the album so that I had some music to listen to on my school trip to France and I instantly fell in love with it. Truly a masterpiece, songs like \"Cleaning out my closet\" or \"Till I collapse\" still give me shivers every time I hear them."
