If we could bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. I sell my prison uniform to the upper class with the stipulation that the money will go to pay off DOC housing costs. If other convicts did the same, we would cure the prison deficit. The celebrity class/upper class could sponsor an ex-con and provide incentives for those trying to stay clean while also being active in the community. I sell my uniform to highest bidder and use that money to pay off court fines and prison fees. Other convicts do the same thus curing the prison deficit."
