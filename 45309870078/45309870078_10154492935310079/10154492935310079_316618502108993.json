Did you hear that? Huh! Are you catchin that?! \nIf so we'd better be getting a silent moment for such commitment - and set a spark of light for that flame of such inspiration .\nI tell you that's the life I live!\n\nLmfol! I was on a whole other level that day that I thought I heard this song. I'm not sure if I did it or you but that's what was in my head."
