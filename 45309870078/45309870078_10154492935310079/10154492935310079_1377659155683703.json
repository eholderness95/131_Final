        "message": "Eminem is the best because unlike all these other rappers (Tupac and biggie included) he didn't just ride one style or gimmick or subjects.\nHe has taken every track to task and risked to create new styles of storytelling...\nAnd that shit right there, storytelling! What most rappers maybe get going in 4 songs in their whole career... He does it every song.\nHe LITERALLY stands above other rappers as a Shakespeare and Chopin combined and modernized and expressing all his joy and pain in one great fucking human being and genius.\n\nHe stands higher than Elvis and Micheal Jackson put together and the fucking world should grind to a fucking halt for 3 days as we watch to see if he rides from his grave to lead us as the second coming!\n\nMaybe not literally lol but fuck it'd be awesome."
