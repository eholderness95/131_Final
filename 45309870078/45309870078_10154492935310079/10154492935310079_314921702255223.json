        "message": "I am a 48 year old  women and I like most of Eminems music because I can actually understand what he is saying , lol Most rappers mumble and don't articulate enough to be able to learn the lyrics to their songs so I can't sing along . I like to understand the message too . I give all music a chance ! I also don't care for the  need to use vulgarity and swear words to get your point across or to make you look and act bad ! Just an old lady's opinion \ud83d\ude00 . I listen to all kinds of music depending on the mood I'm in . Life is way to short sing and dance like no one is watching \ud83d\ude0e"
