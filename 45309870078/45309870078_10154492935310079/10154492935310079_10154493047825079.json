        "message": "The first music video I ever saw was 'The Real Slim Shady'. The first album I bought (I casette form, because it was cheaper) was 'The Eminem Show'. When I saw Jim introducing you at the MTV Awards I was filled with joy, since he is my favorite actor. The fact that the ties go a little deeper makes me that much more happier. Keep up the good word, and FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, SOMEONE PLEASE SHOW THIS PICTURE TO JIM CARREY! xD"
