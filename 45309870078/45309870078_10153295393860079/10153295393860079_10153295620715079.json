        "message": "My all time favorite Hip-Hop/Rap artist, hands down better than anyone alive or dead... Some of you may hate me for saying that, but no other lyricist has kept me from killing myself, when I was younger I could relate to Eminem. I knew what it was like to grow up with out a farther, to see my mom strung out on drugs, to act like an idiot because no one would stop me. But at the end of the day, when I was all alone, I would just sit back and listen to Eminem and I didn't feel like I was the only one who had a shitty upbringing. I'm at least glad he could make something for himself, give people like me hope for the future, and understanding that shit happens, so for that I thank him."
