        "message": "This is why kids nowadays need to understand why Eminem is one of the greatest rappers of our generation! He has so much reverence and understanding of the techniques and lyricism of hip hop that he has always rigorously studied the greats of the past to become a true disciple and master of his art. This post should encourage any kid who claims they're a \"rap fan\" to fuck what whack garbage they're listening to on the radio or a run of the mill mixtape, go back in time, pick up one of these classic albums, study it and understand the influences that have made Eminem the phenomenal MC that he is! That music in that photo is the start/confirmation of music that could enrich a true hip hop fan for their lifetime. Thank you Em for enlightening us! \u270c"
