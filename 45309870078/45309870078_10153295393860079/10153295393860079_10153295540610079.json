        "message": "I am John Herrick The owner of Big John's Plumbing. I have been giving it great thought about the water crisis in Flint and I think I have come up with a longer term temporary solution to the problem. Since nobody in Flint want's to pay for the contaminated drinking water I have come up with an idea. What we do is remove the water meter and install whole house water filter with solid block carbon filters to remove the lead and supply lead test strips so the consumer can test the water. with using the existing meter location you can swap out the meter for the filter really quick with no modifications to the existing plumbing. this would allow for time to repair the water mains. The filters could be changed as needed and the consumer will feel a little more at ease. the customers could just pay estimated bills till the real problem is fixed but allowing people to feel there water is safe."
