        "message": "Hi Marshall, how are you? Thanks for posting this, it's nice to share something that you're up to. You get so many comments that I'm sure you don't get to read them all but I still feel like I need to say to you that - and then the words are not enough!! \ud83d\ude23 You through your story and music are everything to me, you are a golden star shining, I'm so privileged to have lived in this time that I got to listen to your rhymes, you are the greatest person in the music industry your lyrics have inspired people of all backgrounds, you have encouraged and given people strength - all the while whilst fighting demons and battles of your own- and we all have demons and know how hard times can be, but you excelled and kept writing and fighting. You deserve every message of thanks and appreciation from all these Facebook fans  \ud83d\ude09 you earned it. And I don't care how big your bank balance is! You are an amazing human being and that's worth so much more than all the money in the world. \nI am a married woman with 3 small beautiful kids, living in the UK. You have been in my life through music for 15 years now (wow!) you've given me strength and lots of laughs too- I love rapping along with you and man o man, I would give anything and everything to meet you. Sending you love, well wishes, I'll be a fan forever and ever xx\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude09 oh and please please come back to do a gig in London soon!!"
