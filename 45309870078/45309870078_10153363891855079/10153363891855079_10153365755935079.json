For posterity, because who the fuck has a tape player anymore? - I'll just get my walkman out and... oh that's right my walkman died in the mid '90s, along with Hip Hop. Leave your albumn where it belongs, as a CD stuck in some bunky old CD stacker, in the boot of someones car."

You going to revert to VHS as well? A return to vinyl makes more sense. Tapes were an annoying mistake, a moment in time until CD technology made its appearance.
