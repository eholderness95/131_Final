        "message": "Eminem smoke alot of weeds thats why he reason old school, he released the album in 1999 but in CD format, instead of him to put it in cassette format the by now if will go to the CD or DVD format remember as at then alot of people in the world still uses cassette  tape but he chosen to released it in CD because CD were fast taking over cassette player but he decided to go back in time to rerelease it in cassette hoping cassette will make a come back thats be dumb because if u take statistics of recent technology from 1999 till date nor  ever talk about re-modernization of cassette player rather improve version from CD to DVD to Mp3 n Mp4  to LCD etc even in gadget nobody want iPhone 3 anymore but from 5 onwards because its more technology advance now 7 is about to come out. I can categorically say eminem dont know what hes saying he need to go for  a rethink"
