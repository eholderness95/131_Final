        "message": "LOL at the ones here saying I don't have a cassette player anymore but I will still buy it for a collector's item. What a waste and especially when it's probably going to cost $15-$20 dollars....for a cassette tape that you will never listen to. Maybe Eminem can get people to pay 20 bucks for a blank tape and they'd never know it"
