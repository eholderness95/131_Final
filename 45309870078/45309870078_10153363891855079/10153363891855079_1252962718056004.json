        "message": "I got the first one on CD when it first came out (always played it on my walkman that would skip if you moved). This is one of the few rereleases I could actually get behind! Would totally buy this and not unpackage it. That was a classic album; very indicative of the Detroit underground sound, classic 90s, and perfect tone for the whole \"halloween\" story-telling, fantasy style of rap. I'm one of the few people that liked it better than MMLP."
