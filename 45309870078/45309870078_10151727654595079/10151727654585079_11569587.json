Rap shud be a fear for one not to invent it or one shudnt think of touching it. I can beat that shit. Why not compare that shit against with me. With Me\r\n\nWen its time to go on a roll for 4 or 6 continues lines. It shud be breathless. And shud not take pause, or a breath where one comes to know that he's loosing the breath and some take it as pace. Lossibg the breath is known as or is called loosibg the rythm for me. Love rap and I respect it. And to tell u the fact u were the one who invented rap, and i use to follow u after my first breakup. after that u were all that i listened to. Not a fan. BT A COMPANION"
