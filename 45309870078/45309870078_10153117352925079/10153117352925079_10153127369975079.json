        "message": "I know you never read this, and perhaps it is generally no one will read, but my soul will be calm if I still send you this letter. On this day, I want to say thank you for what you came into my life. You have no idea how you affect my outlook, strange, but you became a part of me. I have no father, he is an alcoholic who does not need anyone, but you replaced my father. How do you help me? You teach, give advice, to support in difficult times, you're always there in my mind. And now I can not imagine my life without your music. Thank you Marshall, I love you. Happy Birthday Marshall, I want you to be happy, you deserve it."
