I know im just a fan like anybody else but im here to tell you that my brother Dustin Cressel is worth more than anything to me in tgis world. I can honestly say that if he was to die i would commit suicide no doubt about it but ignore that. What im typing this for is because i am begging you to just have one conversation with my brother on facebook. Dustin Cressel is my brother and to him you are his idol he has note books and notebooks full of his raps but im not askin you to look into that im just askin you  to have one conversation with him you are his idol like ive done said before and this would mean the world to me if you will do this for me please marshal sincerly yours jonathan Jonathan Wayne Cressel"
