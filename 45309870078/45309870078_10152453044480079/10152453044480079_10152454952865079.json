        "message": "I'm not going to apologize. This NEEDS to be said......\n\nEm...I'm a huge supporter and I've got every album.\n\nThis Shady XV was terrible... simply awful. You took the same hits and re-spewed them out to a different beat, that's what it feels like with this album.\n\nRecovery was AMAZING... you showed your growth as an Artist. \nTo see you dumb down like every other rapper out there is straight up disappointing. \n\nThe only thing you did right is not including those talentless skanks Nicki Minaj or Iggy Azalea.\n\nOn a side note... You're not alone. EVERY artist I listen to religiously that put an album out this year has been a disappointment.I hope it changes in the years to come.\n\nI wish you no ill will and I hope you have continued success."
