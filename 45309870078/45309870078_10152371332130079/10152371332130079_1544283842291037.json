        "message": "There is a time when the mind has only himself as an interlocutor\nThe one where his face-to-face with himself exhausts him\nHe escapes and begins to dream, unaware that he is going through phases\nIn his euphoria he finds himself struggling with another spirit, two hands that write, respond\nThen everything falls, once again, the doubts invade it\nThese questions, these moments when he becomes his worst enemy\nA lot of debates and battles in one head, Constantly and for everything, from the banal, to the disappointment there is this detail, the emotional charge, its impact and its shock wave\nAnd it was also, a moment that followed another time,\nNo truce the one where the mind realizes that he has only him as ally\nA heart can be solitary, the mind does not conceive it\nHave abilities but do not know what to do\nA need to share, to give one's way\nI think, I write, you read !!!"
