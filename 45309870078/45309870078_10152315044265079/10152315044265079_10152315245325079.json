        "message": "Since there is no good coming from eminem posting this picture of me with Big Sean, how about Eminem makes something good happen. Eminem, as you can see a cousin of mine, Angela Richards is a fan of yours and she has seen this picture, She is only 17 years old and has a rare kidney disease, this girl has been to hell and back. This girl deserves as much as she can get. She deserves the moon, the stars, the light, and everything in between. Eminem, since you posted this picture of me, please do something for this young girl. I love you Angie."
