I understand ur lyrics and I argue with people all the tine that u are the best with words alive. Some people just don't understand. Ur music has helped me get through so many rough times and situations in my life . I've listened to ur music for years since I was a boy. I used to wear a hoodie with headphones walking around like u in 8 mile when I was younger. If I had one wish it would be to chill with you for a day. And also I will meet u b4 I die"
