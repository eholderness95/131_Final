        "message": "Dude, are you serious? \n\nyeah, I get you wanted to make a campaign speech, but if you not going to bash all of the candidates, you don't need to bring up only one. \n\nFair is fair. If you dis one and not the other, it states alot about your character, such as you are a supporter of the one you did not bash. \n\nAre you really going to let the government control your music now? You make way too much money to be bribed by the government. I guess you have become a puppet for the government, which truly is a disgrace. I have always enjoyed your music, but this, this is not music. I don't even know what to call this. The lyrics are good, as you are an awesome writer. But bring manipulated by the government, when I truly saw a true rap artist that was his own free person, is beyond belief to me. \n\nHow could you do this to your fans? Keep politics out of your music, unless you are going to bash on all candidates and maybe then I might see that you are a free person and not a puppet of the government/media/ and/or clintons. \nBless Your Heart."
