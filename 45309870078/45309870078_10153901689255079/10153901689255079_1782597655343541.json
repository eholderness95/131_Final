        "message": "Over 15 years ago a young boy of 14 years took his saved up money (about 20 bucks), went to the store and bought the Real Slim Shady LP. I remember it, as it was yesterday, holding the CD, putting it in my Discman the first time and then listening to one of the greatest artists of our time! His musik brought me through a lot of shit and I am nothing but thankful that Marshall Mathers took his chance, to conquer the world with the best rap music ever made. Looking forward to the new album."
