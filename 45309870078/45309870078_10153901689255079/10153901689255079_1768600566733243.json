        "message": "Now, all the people who say this song sucks will suddenly become super #1 fans when it or the future album will get famous and more popular as always and everyone will just go like \"oh my god I love Eminem, King of rap, shady's back!\" While at the moment \nthey're just criticizing this wonderful work and saying this is not a song just cause they don't understand the marvelous work behind it and the fact that basically this ain't  a song, not at all and he didn't want to make an actual song, cause we all know that if he wanted to make a real song with instrumental etc, he would have done it without any kind of problems. \n\nI really can't stand when \"fans\" do this. If you're a fan you don't have to like every single song, but at least you have to recognize the potential and not just say \"i used to like you, but now I don't like you anymore. You disappointed me\" and shit like that. Guys, be coherent.\n\nBtw Campaign speech is amazing, just amazing."
