        "message": "Thank you, some of us are still here. The first raps I spit out on my walks home from school were your words. I didnt realize at first, but I ended up thinking deeply and I probably owe a lot of critical thinking skills practice to your influence. Your CD (the white one) was the first one I bought followed by slipknots Vol3. Rap has been a hugely motivational influence in my life, thank you Eminem!\n\nI was thinking just now about who is popular, some rapper named chance leading people to the polls, and I thought, what about slim shady, what about dead prez? where the fuck is the appreciation for the real stars? So, I looked up your page and I'm happy to see theres another album coming.\nActually I would say, take a vacation, you're wealthy now right?"
