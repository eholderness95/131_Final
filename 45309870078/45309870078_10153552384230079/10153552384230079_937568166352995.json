        "message": "I love you so much Eminem. Your my idol I wake up and listen to you go to sleep while listening to you. When I'm older I wanna have my life the exact way as yours is. No love taught me that if you ever get knocked down always get up. Never let no one win because the day you start letting them treat you like shit is the day your life pretty much goes down until you stick up for yourself. You've taught me so many things Eminem and I could never thank you enough. If I ever got the chance to meet you I'd nearly cry. In the near future I actually wanna meet you and do one of your songs with you. Like holy shit that would make me the happiest kid alive. I LOVE YOU EMINEM\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f"
