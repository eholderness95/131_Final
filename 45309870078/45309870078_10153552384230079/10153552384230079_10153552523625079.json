        "message": "Love you Marshall. I've been a fan since I was 11. I remember getting hold of a Cassette tape and I just got hooked, that's when I started collecting all your albums. Your music has helped me through so much, I was bullied and beaten up alot myself, and I know what it feels like to go through depression, mental health and addiction and a lifetime of heartbreak. You really have helped me a lot and I can't thank you enough. You are that bright light that keeps me going everyday."
