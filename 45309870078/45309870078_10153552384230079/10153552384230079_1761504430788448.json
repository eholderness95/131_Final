        "message": "Shady, you're such an inspiration to me. You got me off the drugs, supported me through everything I've been through that gave me PTSD, Dissociative Identity Disorder, Manic Depression, and a severe panic disorder. You've taught me how to break down syllables, how to rhyme, how to join words like crosswords, and how to speak about my pain and lessons hard learned, and share my story with others, and inspire them in the way you've inspired me. I'm dying bro, but I'm striving to be the best artist I can be, because I want to meet you before I go. If I ended up working with you, my life would be complete. I've been following your work for a damn long time now. I would love to talk to you, and tell you who I am, and share stories with you, and seek your wisdom. I hope we get to do that one day. Keep up the good work, Marshall. Love you, mate.\n\n- RHYM"
