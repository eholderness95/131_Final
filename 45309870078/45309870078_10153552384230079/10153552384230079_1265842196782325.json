        "message": "From an EMT working his ass off in Detroit and fighting through school while he does, thank you for the music you make and the heart and soul you pour into it, Eminem. There's been more than a few times i'd go to quit or let up, and your music would come on my playlist, and keep me going.\n\nI can honestly say it's one of the things that got me past my final today. Hope to see you in concert one day too!"
