I have been listening to Tupac lately, even though it was you and your life struggles expressed in your music that helped me get sober and my life together for the first time at the age of 32. I have pulled myself up from hell while listening to your music and I would like to say thank you for your honesty ( I hope)\ud83d\ude09 I am praying for you and your family and pray we are on the same side of the bullshit going on in this world. Stay Strong and God Bless You!"
