He isnt trying to get points across anymore. he focuses on what rhymes best what hes gonna rhyme that nobody else can rhyme, he'll make a word rhyme with a sentence. and I hate when people compare him to tupac. Eminem is a better rapper by his standards but tupac was getting a message across that changed a lot of mind sets for people. the only hing they have in common is that they came from the gutter."
