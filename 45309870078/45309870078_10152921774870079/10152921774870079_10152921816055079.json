This just ain't how the fuck I was raised. Equal rights shouldn't be hated it's a thing to embrace.\n\n You can be an alien from outer space, I wouldn't give a shit if you were gay or straight.\n Bi, no bye bye, I wouldn't say it to your different face. Getting along on this Earth is why we were even placed.\nOpen your mind and think real hard,\nWe are in outer space and this world,\nIt keeps spinnin and spinnin.\nIt keeps spinnin and spinnin.\n\nTo get this through to you I had to Rap it in a rainbow. Oops I mean wrap.\nDon't say that's gay, that's just a rainbow tied in a lyric to get you to\nfeel like a homo. \nOh no!  He said homo!\nLet's freak out and panic.\nLet's get all loud and frantic\nPass judgment and we can't stand it \n\nLooking at this world like,\nIt keeps spinnin and spinnin.\nIt keeps spinnin and spinnin."
