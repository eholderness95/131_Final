Every few years a new fad comes along gets big everyone doing it gets a record deal and when something else comes along those guys are dead. rap artists like Eminem they didn't have all of that. They all had to prove themselves with their skill as Lyricists and rappers. And they actually had to put in a lot of effort before someone would even consider them. That's why guys like Eminem are hundreds of levels higher then these dudes like Kodak, migos, and those goofy looking motherfuckers.
