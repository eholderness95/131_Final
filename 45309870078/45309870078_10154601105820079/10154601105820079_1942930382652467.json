But it's time I start to walk .\nI'm sorry I'm not your girl anymore ... \nThe one you used to love ... \nI used to not put anyone above ya ... \nBut push came to shove\nYour lies and games ... don't work on me anymore ;;;\nI'm not entertained nor anymore surprised ... \nAll I see is emptiness when I look upon your eyes\nYou always second guessed me ... \nYou put me second ... so I started to guess you .. \nI found out who you truly are ... \nPain suffering and misery \nIt's what you love to put people through. \nPeople always owe you ! \nYou only give when you think you will get more in return .. \nLet the next victim feel the burn. \nI know you can play and put on all the charm ... \nIt's when they discover, that you become unarmed .....\nThe mask falls off your face to expose who you truly are. \nSorry Baby .... I don't love you anymore .... \nIt's hard to love a person ... who loves them self more.\nI know you won't read this letter ... \nYou never listened to my words ... \nSo I'm writing a sad love song to make me feel better. \nOne day you'll hear it .... on the radio sitting in your car... \nfamiliar .... distant and far \nBriefly think about me as you gaze out into the stars .. \nAs you hear the tears of the singers voice echo my words .... \nYou'll smile inside yourself .... thinking .. that bitch is absurd.\nCause Baby your not sorry ... you never were ... \nyou were never wrong ... \nYour ego fed away your guilt by finding it's own cure. \nTried to destroy me for being strong, independent and secure. \nYou thought you could me me weak and fall insecure .. \nBaby you were wrong ... \nI'm not that unsure.\nYou took my kindness for weakness .. \nMy forgiveness as me on my knees .\nI'm over .. over trying ... never to achieve\nTrying to love a man who is full of lust and greed. \nI see you talking to new girls all innocent and sweet ... \nIf they only knew you ... and what you've done to me .. \nPlay your game of thrones ... and Game of hearts ... \nBecause in the end ... \nYou'll be the one holding a bad hand of cards\u00a9\nMC/SayDee \u00a9 aka The Devil's Angel"
