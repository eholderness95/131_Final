Has stopped a while because he chose for his family and raised his daughters ... and still makes good music because he loves doing it and not for the money ... so why do you read and interfere with him while he does not interest you? Show some respect ... or else shut your big mouth ... cause he's still Marshall Mathers ... just a regular man ... and he don't give a fuzz about you"

            "message": ":l you're obviously off your alcohol or... Whatever, cause at least these sentences have structure...\r\rEminem hates to love me.. Cause im a prick, your just an idiot who couldn't read the first post correctly cause you're too fucked up to actually just live. I hope you beat your demons, I really hope you can, but don't act like I haven't supported Marshall, the man known as Eminem. He's helped me through the darkness, and helped me fight the pain.. But he wants to start a war... My body is ready.. Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9..\rDon't act like he is innocent in all that he has done, cause fuck me if I didn't do shit, I should have never done. As much as I forgive, I never can forget... I guess that's what makes a man, you are just the opposite. An ignorant, conglomerate  of all the hate thats spewed.. Why would I like him, follow him, bitch I aint that fuckin rude. My mouth has rotted away with all the shit that I can say. But at least I'm honest to myself, my dreams and love each day. You seem to have some issues still, go on an solve those too. Maybe you can smile and be happy just by doing you.\rThe reason i must be a dick, is really fuckin simple. I don't want him to make a useless movie about some useless people. He had gold with 8 mile because, it's his own fucking story. This rap battle crap is only filler, it's dumb and fuckin boring. So don't act like my critique isn't fully validated. Bitch i listened to him thoroughly, before you know, he was worth your time and patience. Im fuckin tired of responding to a hatemonger like you. So please do me a favor, lay off your silly juice. And he gives two fuzz about me boo. What you gonna do? iAM through.... Cause clearly, nothing gets through to you..."
