        "message": "Eminem can give you old shit but why. I like every Album this guy put out he spits every time. The old shit was wicked and he still has it no doubt but the way I see it is that it's evolution. He gives us what we want to hear in my opinion hate Eminem or love him. Can't wait for the new record. Keep at it Eminem I'm 33 and I'll listen to your shit to the day I die."
