Hey you guys, now we have \"gangster theater.\"\nFrank A. would have built the town a new theater in the 80's, the floor was so sticky that we had to pull up on our thigh to unstick our shoes from the floor.   Eminem was in there back then.\nI guess they decided that \"the Show must go on,\" which is why we ended up doing that show in Mulligan's Pub."
