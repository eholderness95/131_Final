        "message": "It becomes focusing on the victim to rehabilitate them... rather than focus on the person who is the real problem and rehabilitate them... so you slowly make the victim the criminal psychologically... now that the victim thinks they are inheritly as bad as the criminal because they are being psychologically chipped away at by supposedly mentally sound professional people they begin to question their own perception of self especially if they come from a broken home. But the social workers could have a college degree in jazz for all tf we know and know nothing at all whatsoever that pertains to their actual job or gives them the appropriate education to make calls about peoples private lives and family lives and diagnose people out of thin air with no real experience what so ever to back it up."
