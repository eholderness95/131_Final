        "message": "I like Em's old shit not gunna lie cause his new songs are not my style that I remember him as. But I'm always a fan of Em! Whenever I sat at the back of my school bus, I'd pop out my ipod, and play Encore. That's when I was bullied. But his music helped me. And in a way miles me into a not givin a dick about ones opinion and really helped me. Thanks Em! Can't wait to see this!"
