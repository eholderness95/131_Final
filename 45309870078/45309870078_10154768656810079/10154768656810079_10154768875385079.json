I hate red clr, Sad looking guy in both sides, tatoos,you were not famous in Sri Lanka, never heard u b4 and i cant remember the reason why i bought that t shirt. Perhaps my senses told me to buy that t shirt cause the bond that im gonna make you with ur music. Still remember and love for forever."
