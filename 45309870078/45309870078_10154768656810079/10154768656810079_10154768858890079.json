Fuck..on no favors he shadow boxed all his bars. If you don't know what that means then just stfu. Em mastered all the old flows so he literally moved on to new ones. All I Think About is chicken scratch flow. Vegas is chainsaw flow. Em is syncopating and rhyming on downbeats and upbeats and everywhere in between. Hes flowing to parts of the beat besides the bass or snare. Hes incorporated modern day battle rap into his writing technique and using modern day battle rap stunt work in his delivery.  Imo his current flow is even better than slim shady bc its less mainstream and different and going against the current grain of shit like migos or Lil yachty. He left behind that nursery school way of flowing. Y'all just need to open your minds and let go of the nostalgia."
