Your music has kept me motivated through it all. Brain cancer sucks but gotta stay positive! Here is a video my wife took of me jamming out to you with bolts through my skull and a mask on ! You're a inspiration to many rather you realize it or not. Hopefully one day I can meet you man !    https://www.facebook.com/glenda.c.frederick/posts/10206424599561740"
