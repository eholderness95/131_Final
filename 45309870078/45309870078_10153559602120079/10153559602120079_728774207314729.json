I had this on my binder in highschool.\n\nRichard Cory\nWhenever Richard Cory went down town,\nWe people on the pavement looked at him:\nHe was a gentleman from sole to crown,\nClean favored, and imperially slim.\n\nAnd he was always quietly arrayed,\nAnd he was always human when he talked;\nBut still he fluttered pulses when he said,\n\"Good-morning,\" and he glittered when he walked.\n\nAnd he was rich \u2013 yes, richer than a king \u2013\nAnd admirably schooled in every grace:\nIn fine, we thought that he was everything\nTo make us wish that we were in his place.\n\nSo on we worked, and waited for the light,\nAnd went without the meat, and cursed the bread;\nAnd Richard Cory, one calm summer night,\nWent home and put a bullet through his head."
