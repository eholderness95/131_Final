As we recover together, we not only listen to others talk in meetings, we also watch how they walk through their recovery. The more we get to know other members, the more we become aware of how they live their lives. We may form opinions about how they \"work their program.\" We may find that certain members upset us, or we may even hear ourselves say, \"If I worked their program, I would surely use.\"\n\nWe have found tolerance to be a principle that no only strengthens our own recovery, but also our relationships with individuals who are a source of irritation to us. It becomes easier to accept other members' frailties when we remember that we ourselves rarely turn over our own character defects until we become painfully aware of them.\n\nJust for Today: I will strive to accept others as they are. I will try not to judge others. I will focus on the principles of love and acceptance."
