If you wana listen to some quick n easy listen to the modern crap that gotten on the streets. Marshal is an amazing  rapper with a lot of talent but talent aint sht if you dont work hard with it. Em tells a story with his music. Most ppl today just talk about getting high drunk and hollering at big assed women. That sht aint rap material."
