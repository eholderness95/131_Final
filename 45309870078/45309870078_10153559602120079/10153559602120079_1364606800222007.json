        "message": "My 11 yr old son is a huge fan. He completed a novel loosely based on your life and his own life wherein he gets to meet you and shows the world what a wonderfully kind person you are. He wrote the novel IN 30 DAYS for a contest while completing all other homework and after school activities. Here is the award he received. \n\nThere is a kid outside of Tampa for whom you are his hero. Not because of your success. Not because you can write and rap. But because he thinks you're the bravest artist ever for your honest lyrics. \n\nHats off to you for showing young boys it's GOOD to express yourself. And even better to go for it all in life!"
