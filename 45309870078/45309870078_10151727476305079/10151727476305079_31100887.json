        "message": "Hello Marshall, I do not know if you will have time to answer me goal, I seek your first vinyl with the song fucking backstabber of 1995. An original would be too surely much expensive for me but would have it a republication? If so, where I could find some because I do not find and I would like really to find it. I would appreciate really an answer, but if you do not answer me it is not serious I would manage. Thank you for your music you put to us in trancet!
