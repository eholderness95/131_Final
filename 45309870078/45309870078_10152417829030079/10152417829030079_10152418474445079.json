Your biggest fan, this is Dan."

I did this for fun because I was bored one day after work and sick of seeing the same picture posted getting thousands of likes, thought it would be refreshing to see something different.  I am not a real life Stan who is going to go crazy and don't actually want to die when I'm alone(thats a reference to SFTM).  I am however, a real life huge fan and do have a collection and had to use the Stan template in order to get my rhymes started.  Some lines are true for me and some are fiction just for the song.  But don't get me wrong, if I got a like from Eminem or even noticed, I might have a heart attack."
