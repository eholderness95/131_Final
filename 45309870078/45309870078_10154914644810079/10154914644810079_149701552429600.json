        "message": "I don't care if Eminem likes Trump or not, I voted for and support president Trump.  However when he said to choose between him and the president he lost me. Still love his music but to make your fans choose shows me you think your opinion is more important than it actually is.\n       Shut up and Rap, it's what you are good at,leave politics to grown ups that don't come from a city that democrats destroyed."
