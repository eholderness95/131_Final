I understand his reasonings for doing what he did at the BET Awards. I'm always and forever still going to be a Fan of Em and listen to all of his songs. I just feel like I'm the only one who voted for Trump who STILL loves Eminem. So sad that politics get in the way of fucking everything. We would still be fucked if Hillary won. Hillary... Trump... Both pieces of shit. Idgaf what anyone thinks or has to say. I stand by my President and MORE IMPORTANTLY I still LOVE Eminem.... That is all."
