Really? Are we gonna play a game? Are we racing? Oh is it a rap battle? Or do you really think that saying you choose em vs our president is\nGoing to do or change anything? Why would I choose em? Does he have the power to change my life your life everyone\u2019s life and by everyone I mean the world. No, oh well the president does so yep all makes for a good read though"
