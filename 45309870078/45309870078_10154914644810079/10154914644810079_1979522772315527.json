He doesn't need to \"become relevant again\" because he always was & will be relevant.  That's what happens when you're one of the greatest at what you do.\n\nSecondly, you complain about Em's fans not being able to \"formulate our own ideas\" and how we need to \"hop off his dick\".  Yet, you strike me as one of those \"MAGA\" on everything kinda people.  I don't expect a staunch Trump supporter to get that level of irony.  Eminem fans would cuz, you know, thinking and stuff."
