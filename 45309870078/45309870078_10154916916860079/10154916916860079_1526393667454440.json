The ukulele (/ju\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8le\u026ali\u02d0/ yoo-k\u0259-LAY-lee, from Hawaiian: \u02bbukulele [\u02c8\u0294uku\u02c8l\u025bl\u025b] (oo-koo-leh-leh); variant: ukelele, is a member of the lute family of instruments; it generally employs four nylon or gut strings or four courses of strings. Some strings may be paired in courses, giving the instrument a total of six or eight strings.\n\nThe ukulele originated in the 19th century as a Hawaiian adaptation of the Portuguese machete, a small guitar-like instrument, which was introduced to Hawaii by Portuguese immigrants, mainly from Madeira and the Azores. It gained great popularity elsewhere in the United States during the early 20th century and from there spread internationally.\n\nThe tone and volume of the instrument vary with size and construction. Ukuleles commonly come in four sizes: soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone."
