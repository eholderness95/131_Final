        "message": "Why white? Why a quote of this certain song? This is the fuckersong....so bad...why are you using it here, Marshall? This song has not been the reason for anything at all. The original song for the love I gave to you about 8 years is \"Beautiful\"..and nothing else and of course..\"Lose yourseslf\"....too and others. White is my colour...as a teacher of Kundalini Yoga which I have been before you came into my life.. The colour of innocence....The ONE who loved you and then could not get any love, word or tenderness or support from you. But you had a nice experience and I am now ...in Germany and had no experience of that kind.I only got hate and diffamation. I created everything for you and you didnt give me back anything, because I loved you only.."
