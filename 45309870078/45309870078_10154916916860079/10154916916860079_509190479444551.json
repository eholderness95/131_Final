        "message": "Interesting how Eminem magically becomes a social justice warrior now that Trump is President. Yep, that's right... The same Eminem who talks shit about gays, wrote songs about shooting up with drugs in front of his daughter, raps about \"kicking a pregnant bitch in the stomach\", and lets not forget about Stan driving off a bridge with his pregnant girlfriend in the trunk (just a few examples).  Now all of a sudden this guy wants to act like he's offended by Trump when his own sole purpose in life is to be offensive.  He doesn't give a shit or a sloppy fuck about anyone other himself and selling his next album.  Do any of you understand what a rouse is?"
