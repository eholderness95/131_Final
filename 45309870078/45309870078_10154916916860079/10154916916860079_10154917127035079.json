Still not as funny as his terrible \"freestyle\", nor the fact that his crying isn't gonna change Trump being his president for the next 3 to 7 years. That's hilarious actually \ud83d\ude02.\n\nPS...Trump supporters don't care. He's president. Nothing matters anymore. Just because we comment calling him garbage, doesn't change that fact. We're simply replying to his \"salty\" shitty freestyle."
