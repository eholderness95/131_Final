        "message": "Hi Mr. Mathers, my name is Ember Crowley and I'm in 10th grade here in Flagstaff Arizona and I am a filmmaker. I am working on a feature-length (30 minutes or longer) black-and-white film that has four small films within its structure. I've almost completed a a Documentary (my first doc...) , I won $1000 grant for my school that had absolutely no film supplies!  and have had another film chosen to be showcased at an independent film theater! This is such a longshot but just thought I would ask if you might be interested in being in one of my short films? In all honesty, I don't know much about your music, however, I admire your road to recovery so much, especially being that both of my parents are clean and sober.  I have never had to see them pick up a drug or drink. It's a daily reprieve, as I understand. I hope all is well for you and that you have a beautiful day! Thank you for taking the time to read this."
