        "message": "Thank you for making music to help us get through all the bullshit in our lives. I've been a fan since I first heard My Name Is back in 1999. I had one of those little kid red/blue/yellow speakers with a microphone and my cousin used to rap My Name Is to me on it haha. He could imitate your voice so well. Anywho, thank you for sharing your life, your wisdom, and your art with us. Your art has got me through so much!"
