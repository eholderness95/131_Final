        "message": "May 19, 2016\n\nA growth inventory\n\nPage 145\n\n\"We review our past performance and our present behavior to see what we want to keep and what we want to discard.\"\n\nBasic Text, p. 29\n\nAs each day winds to a close, many of us reflect on the past twenty-four hours and consider how we can live differently in the future. It's easy for our thoughts to remain trapped in the mundane: change the oil in the car, keep the living room clean, or empty the litter box. Sometimes it takes a special effort to jog our thinking out of the daily rut and onto a higher track. \n\nOne simple question can put us on the high road: What do we think our Higher Power wants for us tomorrow? Maybe we need to improve our flagging conscious contact with the God of our understanding. Perhaps we've been uncomfortable in our job or our relationship, holding on only out of fear. We might be hiding some troubling defect of character, afraid to share it with our sponsor. The question is, in what parts of our lives do we really want to grow? \n\nAs each day ends, we find it beneficial to take some moments to spend time with our Higher Power. We can begin to reflect on what will benefit our program of spiritual growth most in the coming day. We think about the areas in which we have grown recently, and target areas that still require work. What more fitting way to end the day?\n\nJust for Today: I will set aside some time at the end of the day to commune with my Higher Power. I will review the past day, meditating on what stands between me and my Higher Power's will for my life."

I loathe and define myself on a good day? I don't know how to be anything but what I am. Which is nothing and nobody and always always aware and uncomfortable in my skin. I tried to run away from it but it followed me so it could mock me to the very end and shatter the glimmer of happiness that I had for one brief moment. It's hopeless. I can't be but what I am and everyone needs to back off. I can't do this."
