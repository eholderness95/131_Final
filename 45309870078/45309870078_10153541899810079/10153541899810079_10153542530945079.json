        "message": "Maybe your just scared to meet him because you do have a desire to meet him. Why follow and post on this? I've said the exact same thing before, but thats only because I'm scared to meet someone that has litterally speaks my mind and expresses exact moments I've had I feel we've shared and makes my heart litterally sink though my body and gives me chills when I relize how similar we are. How he makes me feel we've lived the same moments and I can't get him out of my head sometimes. I've even thought I'd run the other way but I hate the thought of never talking to you and the thought of you never knowing how your songs come into play into my life how much love I've felt from afar the day after my dog got hit from a car your song really helped me. If I did meet you if would change everything. People say things that they dont mean."
