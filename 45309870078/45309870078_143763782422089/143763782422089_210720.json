        "message": "I recently survived a Reality TV show.   AVOID THEM IF U CAN!   It's brutal, they want aggression and fighting and i'm just not into that sort of thing to get on stage but i did my best.  I worked my friggin' ass off and so my oldest kid with me.    Yet NONE of it aired.   At least i managed to avoid getting the pie in the face exposure.    All i wanted was a stage on TV to air my own musical talent.   I dont' want to try any more friggin' contests where you have to perform \"compared to others\".   I just want \"a stage\" that is my own.   But it might be too late in life for me...i'm 39 yrs old.      <3 <3 <3 you guys rock, cheers."
