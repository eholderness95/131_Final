Do they not vote? What the hell gives anyone the right to tell someone whether or not they can have an opinion,or a say in how their country is being run by \"Their\" representatives? \nBeing a celebrity doesn't make them.any less relevant then you or the next person.\nAlso let's not forget Trump was a celebrity before running for President,so by your logic, he should keep his mouth shut about politics, right?"
