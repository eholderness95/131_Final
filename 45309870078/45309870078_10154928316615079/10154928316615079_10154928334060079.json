Just because I disagree with somebody doesn't mean that I'm not going to listen to their music, because somebody disagrees with me doesn't mean that they don't have to like me. I love Eminem's music and will always, always listen to his music regardless of what he says. That has got me through some really tough times in my life and I hold it dear to my heart. Remember you're free to not like somebody if you wish but because someone tells you to fuck off doesn't mean you got to stalk their page and bitch in moan on their posts. That's part of the problem in America. I will always support Eminem's music regardless if he agrees disagrees or has a totally different take on politics than I do.."
