Just a side bit of FYI With ever changing industry schedules  I was committed to Sicario  however I was able to prep Jake's make up and hair concepts  initially - thanks to Kay Georgiou for coming into cut his hair and set the look of it -  I  hired some great colleagues Linda Dowds to do the film in my place- she established  much of it and the tattoos all rather last minute  frenzy -as it evolved in workload and requirements  I called in  Louie Zakarian initially for life cast and about midway  he took over the day to day work on Jake   well done all!!   -just wanted to point out it was a group effort in every way and in the end Jake did an amazing job and thrilled for him"
