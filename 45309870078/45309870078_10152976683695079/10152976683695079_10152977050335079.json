We instill in them the best qualities we have to offer with our Hopes and Prayers they will repeat the same when they are given the same opportunity.. What you do to teach your little Angels will make this world Brighter or Darker . Break the cycles that repeat and make peace with everything.. My time with you all runs short Veritas is not needed Aequitas is.. Pray often and Always.. By my home world I will one day see Again. I have been away from Home too long. Bless you All .. In nomine patri et filii et spiritus sancti.. Amen Father Amen... (\u5929 \u795e ---- \u5929 \u6383) Ti\u0101n  Phuc ---- Ti\u0101n S\u01ceo"
