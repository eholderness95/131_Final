        "message": "Y'all say I'm fat and ugly, broke with no money but I don't give a fuck because I eat negativity to fill my round stomach and laugh at you babies without dummy's// isn't it funny how you chumps take the piss outta me... Well im'a take a dump on ya head like a chimpanzee living high in the trees// I might just be a little angry but seriously don't fuck with me and we'll all be happy!!! \nNow that I've said my piece let's be positive and burn this weed... Wait...I've quit burning shit but y'all can still spark an owl on this bitch and relax to this hype ish// I've got a wish which I'd like to be famous and have a big house for my family to live in, fuck all the sins I may have committed, I'm clean now cooking up mean shit in Gordon's kitchen with the whole world watching on there television// I had a vision that jesus almighty gave me a visit and told me that I'd be the grand wizard and wipe out the hip hop society like a snowy blizzard// I'm over trying to climb walls like some kind of lizard so for once can y'all just pay attention and listen!!! Is there anything I'm missing? I'm on a mission, not to Mars though// my journey has just begun bro, I am going to be successful just that I know it'll take some time Yo, but if I get my mind on the straight and narrow I'll be hitting targets like robin hood with a bow and arrow// I'll always fight to the death, even if it means I go to the depth of my very last breath, at least I've given it my very best and released all the tension and stress, life's put me to the test... I've passed with straight A's, nothing's gunna take my life away because I've got it made, I've slayed my demon's so I can't misbehave, the evil shits archived and is on history's page// it's time for me to entertain y'all on the main stage and blow up this microphone like a hand grenade, I wanna make y'all dance and rave, whilst I rage like an ape going crazy in a locked up cage// I'm johnny on the spot with lyrics as hard as rock, I'm straight off the top, one day I'll pass away but my spirit will never be forgotten and live on..."
