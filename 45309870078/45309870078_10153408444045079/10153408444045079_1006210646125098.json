We looked to them to support us and supply the things we found lacking in ourselves.\"\n\nBasic Text, pp. 70-71\n\nIn the animal kingdom, there is a creature that thrives on others. It is called a leech. It attaches itself to people and takes what it needs. When one victim brushes the leech off, it simply goes to the next. \n\nIn our active addiction, we behaved similarly. We drained our families, our friends, and our communities. Consciously or unconsciously, we sought to get something for nothing from virtually everyone we encountered. \n\nWhen we saw the basket passed at our first meeting we may have thought, \"Self-support! Now what kind of odd notion is this?\" As we watched, we noticed something. These self-supporting addicts were free. By paying their own way, they had earned the privilege of making their own decisions. \n\nBy applying the principle of self-support in our personal lives, we gain for ourselves the same kind of freedom. No longer does anyone have the right to tell us where to live, because we pay our own rent. We can eat, wear, or drive whatever we choose, because we provide it for ourselves. \n\nUnlike the leech, we don't have to depend on others for our sustenance. The more responsibility we assume, the more freedom we'll gain.\n\nJust for Today: There are no limits to the freedom I can earn by supporting myself. I will accept personal responsibility and pay my own way today. Eminem mt son being raised bye hatchet men they took the mark and every thing."
