        "message": "Hey Eminem, I know  this is a lot to ask, and you don't even know me, but my girlfriend is going through shit right now that a 15 year old shouldn't be going through. Her aunt is in a coma at the hospital, and she's always so hard on herself. You are one of few of her favorite singers. I am asking that yo make a song for her, that will make her day. We are in Bridgeport, West Virginia. I love her dearly, and I can't stand to see her like this. I understand if you don't want to, I just thought it would be something that would make her happy."
