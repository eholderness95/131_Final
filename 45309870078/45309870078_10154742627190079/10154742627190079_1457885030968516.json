        "message": "Been listening to you, for over 20 years,  Why in the hell did you just disrepect alot of your fans, i  bet you had more Trump supportesr fans  than snowflakes, douth most of them college kids got you there.   for you to disrepect so many of your fans, was down right pitiful.  You already had the fans in the crowd  loving you, so what was the reason you chose to hate on somebodys political  views. i would have walked right out, but i guess when you get over the top, you can show your real chacater, and fuck them to right, the ones that helped get you there. Im pissed more for loving your music for 20 years, just to say Fuck Eminem."
