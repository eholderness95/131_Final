Very interesting to say the least. The simple answer is that you can't handle the fact that em hates Trump. Grow up...sometimes people will have different opinions than you. Learn some real coping methods. Pac would've hated Trump. Most people from his community do....hence why Em also hates him. Why in tf are you surprised that em would share most of the same beliefs as the black community when he grew up in a predominantly black hood in the ghettos of Detroit? \n\nBtw....Em would rap circles around Pac. Easily."
