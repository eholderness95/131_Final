Strap him with an Ak-47, let him go, fight his own war.\"\nEminem in 2017, in Glasgow two nights ago, wearing a t-shirt that says 'FACK TRUMP': \u201cScotland, you might have to be our new home because right now shit ain\u2019t going so well in the States. I just want to take this moment right now to say motherfuck Donald Trump!\u201d\nTrump supporters on social media: \"Oh my god! I can't believe what Eminem said about the president! I'm so surprised! I'm never going to buy his records again. This isn't the Eminem I have supported all these years!\"\nBut this is exactly the Eminem they have, apparently, supported all these years. Why are they so enraged that he speaks his mind just as he has been doing all these years?"

My point was that people shouldn't be surprised that, in 2017, Eminem is expressing similar sentiments to those he expressed in 2004. That's consistent. It would be like being shocked when Richard Dawkins says he doesn't believe in god. I'm not talking about the quality of Eminem's music or, indeed, whether his political views are right or wrong...I'm just laughing at the idea that people might be surprised that he would insult the president of the US. Of course he does - he has,  many times before."
