Definitely has nothing to do with all the billionaires and pharmaceutical companies and such that really run our country, that make it impossible for the middle class of America to be able to survive. That's what is killing our country, you know, that and our shady, courrupt, backward ass judicial system. Oh yeah, not to mention a world that has forgotten some of the simplest shit like things as easy as please and freaking thank you!! My 3 yr old has better manners and is more respectful than 75% of the people I encounter every single damn day. And all those asses are the ones raising our next generation of kids. I have a wonderful idea, instead of blaming our fucked up world and getting your panties in a wad over someone cuz they don't like trump, how bout we start treating people the way you would wanna be treated. That's a lost thing these days and to me that's the biggest problem with our world. All these people wanna bitch about stuff but do nothing about it, so take a good long look in the mirror and if you don't like the way things are going then how bout you be a part of the solution and not the problem. Might be a hard concept for some people, but maybe a little something to think about."

If everyone came together and Loved one another as the bible said you would see great changes spread about this world..But through hate songs and media and people, this world is torn apart...We have got to stand up and  Call out the problem for change to take place.  Right now we have people all over Texas , who are in shelters who need support and donations...instead of seeing Protesting In other parts of the Country , It would be nice to see everyone come too help people , even in the town they live in...I do know this , what you do on Earth is known  To God....He is the Judge!  Stop the hate Spread the LOVE!"
