I still do. Until I heard The Way I Am and the Fucker called me out Cuz I was one of those cocky caucasians who thought he was a wigger who tried to be black etc. etc. Gave that some bitch mad props for that then listened to the whole album. Been a fan ever since. Still don't like some of his shit but that's me with any musician."
