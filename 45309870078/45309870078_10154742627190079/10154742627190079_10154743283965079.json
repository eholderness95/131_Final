            "message": "Really, this is why-What is going on? Praying to Allah in the House of Representatives?  Our country is that of a third world country! I just saw a video of Obama saying to the world that America is no longer a Christian nation or America but a globalist state.  America is no longer America? What really surprised me is that no one said anything; no one! Everyone has something to say about everything but they can\u2019t identify treason from the President! What is happening in our country\u2026\u2026\nCommon Sense- Look to the root of a problem NOT the symptom. The current condition of our country is the result of Ideology Subversion which began over 40 years ago. It is the strategy used by communists and totalitarians to take over a society from within. The enemy is not identified by citizens because the process is slow and the society is under the belief that they are not at war but peace. They have no idea the enemy is within. Ideology Subversion is the process of taking over a country from within the society. The plan (45 Goals of American Communists) was introduced to Congress in 1963; it is on record. The stages are: 1. Demoralization-to debase the faith and minds of the society. Promote other religions contrary to the religion that controls the system. Promote a weak education programs, promote drug use, all immoral activities that are contrary to the fundamental belief or faith of the society. ect. 2. Destabilization-this is the process of bringing down the economic system through financial programs that bankrupt the system, social rioters planted in society which sit as cells until the time of action (years later) Financial Lawlessness at the corporate level and within the community; letting murderers get away with murder. This is where we are today; cell groups stirring up riots, financial institutions stealing millions of dollars from people without being punished, the government bankrupting the country through massive giving to the society, removal of fundamental laws, for example, Constitutional Rights. Political destabilization is seen by the lawlessness that is permitted by the government; executive order by Obama making slavery law. Immigration breaks the society financially while weakening, practically destroying the systems religion. The only thing that will cause someone to stop this from happening is FAITH; thus, explaining why it is necessary to demoralize the society first. 3. Crisis is the third stage; this happens when the economic, financial, political, and religious systems are destroyed. Riots are constant, wrong is morally right and religion is under attack, financial institutions are not protected, lawlessness is rampant the government becomes stronger than its people and more dictatorial, political parties are merged into one controlled by the enemy. People who are brainwashed into the ideology are baffled by what is happening in the society, left speechless, cannot understand or explain anything; this is because they do not realize the enemy is within the government bringing their society to the final stage or normalization; the takeover by force once the country has collapsed. The communist government seizes all businesses, homes, and rights; calling this the \"normalization\" stage. They win. They did it by making you think that there was no threat of war and that we had peace and the entire time they were deceiving you. Anti- Christ comes in peacefully and ends up destroying you. The problem is that once the society figures out what is happening it is usually too late."
