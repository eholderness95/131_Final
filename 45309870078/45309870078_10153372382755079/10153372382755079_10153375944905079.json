        "message": "\"em I'm not going to sue\" and I'm trying hard for the right of people of chemistry to record a better record label.  After I finish college and get some type of career my hobby stays who I am.  Even though I know it's a tough music industry business  I don't want to get shot I want a shot a record label. Since you have been using my material the passed 10 years. I know music better than you do.  I have a formula of psychology and it builds \"I don't give fuck\" I'll have my way either you like, or not.  When Bernie Sanders becomes president you have my respect, but there is not going to be anymore music stolen from my experiments.  I'm being a man about it and I salute.  Oh by the way, if you ever play around with your phone tappers and put my words on track.  I will spill your marbles and your legacy  like a pimp when you don't even know it!  Peace YOBOY TWIZZY!"
