One thing he said is that he always wants to evolve, that he wants his albums not to sound like any of his previous albums.  That's the sign of a great artist.\n\nYeah, I love his older stuff.  To this day, I think TES is (pound for pound) his best.  MMLP & SSLP are really sick and will always be classics.  But the guy has kept pumping out albums & staying relevant.  Are they at the same caliber as his first 3? It depends.  He's added a lot of complexity to his music & lyrics.  I'm sure if he'd kept putting out albums that sounded/felt like SSLP/MMLP/TES, he'd be untouchable.  But as a great artist, he wanted to change things up."
