        "message": "I just want to take a moment to tell you that I find you to be an amazing artist!  I have since your start with Dre.  I have two children who were raise listening to you. Being a school teacher, single mother, and 44 years old it is sometime frowned upon, but I don't care!  Your story and music have helped me through tough times!  You have always reminded me that you can fight through tough times and still come out on top.  Financially I struggle, but that is my problem.  You have helped me most with understanding what I need to do to best help my children as they were becoming young adults!  Life has never been easy for me, and I figure it has just made me who I am.  I used your music as a way to help my children understand that they too could use the difficult life they were given to help themselves grow into amazing young adults!  Thank you for staying true to who you are!  I hope you and you family have an amazing Christmas!"
