I've been Stan since 12 and i really want to meet you so baaaadly I know that I'll meet you but I don't know when. Because you taught me to never give up in my dreams this is my biggest dream I cry everytime I listen to you music you make me laugh sad everything at the same time I love you more than everything in my life. You changed my life I can't imagine my life without you. I would die if I met you. I know you won't read this but I just want to say what's in my heart long time ago. When I see your face or listen to your music everything comes better. The world is nothing without you Marshall. You are the king. Words can't describe how much I love you.
