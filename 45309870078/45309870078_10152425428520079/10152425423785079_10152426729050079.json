        "message": "This is my Grandpa in Korea in 1952, He wasn't fighting for himself he was fighting for you. We won that battle but no one really has a clue, of the real reasons he had to shoot. When he came home he met my grandma and made her his wife, 60 years with no strife. No one understands why she had to die leaving him once again alone to cry."
