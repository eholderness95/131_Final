        "message": "When Eminem leaves the game, there will be not a single man or woman on earth that wont feel it. If you understood that he IS becoming older and has matured then you would see that he really is \"better\" as a human.\nEven if you think that Eminem fell off you have to admit... EVEN DRE (Who is respected as the scout for talent) fell off and produced a few songs that are \"good\" but they where very mainstream (Kush, sex, money, famous, NONSENSE).\n\nIf you haven't noticed Eminem (In recent years) hasn't rapped about drugs or killing people or his bad relationships. If you notice closely, this song is (in my point of view) one of Eminem's best because he is admitting that he is getting old and that he has matured (\"Id rather make Not Afraid 2 than another motherfucking we made you\") and his mentality has changed.\n\nIn my point of view \"Rap God\" is a good song that shows his talent as a rapper...\n\n                        |>BUT<| \n\n(Guts Over Fear, Legacy, Evil Twin, Monster, ETC.) talk about how he got to where he is and how he understands his demons.\n\nHe knows he is getting old and running out of good ideas for lyrics (\"But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?\nAnd the lights go out in that trailer park?\"). He understands that the public has stopped believing in him because that \"Light\" and the \"spark\" of hate that he had with him when he began his career is leaving him (\"And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun\").\n\nHis lyrics are softer now because he has understood that life is full of hardships and that we shouldent take it out on others when it could also be his fault. The angry blond will live on in our hearts as long as we keep it there...\n\n                        |>BUT<| \n\nWe HAVE to realize that slim shady is his DEMON, created by all the hate and mistreatment that he received (\"Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt just having to balance my dang self but on eggshells I was made to walk but thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium at least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done\") and that this \"Monster\" inside him is what made him famous.\n\nHe WILL NOT go back to that persona and \"Monster Feat. Rihanna \" explains that.\n\nBut most of all he thanks us... He thanks US because he understands that even in tough times, we are his \"Soldiers up in his corners\" we are (to him) worth more than a Grammy or any award. (Unlike rappers now adays, Nicky Minaj for example wrote \"Fuck all you\").\n\nEminem wrote this song for US the REAL fans that understand him! (\"So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted, I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song and everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more from this day forward, just let them a-holes talk take it with a grain of salt.\")\n\nWhen Eminem leaves the game, there will be an emptiness in my heart that will never be filled.\n\nEminem, your TRUE fans are still here and we arn't leaving.\n\nI still believe in you.\n\nStan"
