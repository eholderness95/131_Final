What crosses peoples thoughts when they pull out a knife and what makes them want to destroy innocent peoples lives. Why is it when anyone even looks at you once, Chav\u2019s think its necessary to pull out a gun. BANG. The UK is getting scabbier by the day, the government letting protesters get their way, as civilians don\u2019t get their say. The general public, looking in awe, watching in horror wondering why chav\u2019s are doing this for, britain\u2019s geting poorer. I can\u2019t believe Britain can sleep at night, when murderers, terrorists and pedo\u2019s are potentially in sight, criminals turning off  lights, we still need to separate wrong from right \nChorus: Oi, yeah you sittin on the wall, whos the baddest of them all, you can see it better believe it, everyone can see you fall"
