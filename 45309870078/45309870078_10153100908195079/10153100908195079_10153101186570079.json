Grow up people don't look up to others be yourself and find what you're good at"

Music has been a massive influence through my whole life and I can say for sure that some people have talent and others don't. How much time you put in does matter, however no matter how much you put in you never will be as good as someone with talent. Why do you think mozart is more famous than let's say Richard Wagner? Wagner was an incredible influence on musical culture however most people haven't even heard of him and everyone has heard of mozart. Why do you think that is? Wagner dedicated his whole life to music and so did mozart. However mozart spent a lot of time sleeping with other women, so really it was Wagner who put in more time. Now don't you think that Wagner should be more famous? Not really because mozart was a genius at what he does and Wagner was extremely talented. I don't know if I explained my point well enough, however some people have music come naturally to them and others have to work to achieve greatness. However the one who works greatly will not necessarily become the greater artist, simply because music doesn't come as easily for him. Eminem is the best because he is a genius at what he does. And people like dizzy wright, or kerser will never make it to his level because no matter how much effort they put in, they are simply not good enough."

But, just because an individual isn't well known doesn't mean they aren't talented, just because mozart was more famous, doesn't mean he can look down on \"less talented\" musicians. And sammi and mike lind, I've only listened to every song, every freestyle and watched every interview, you think I don't know who eminem is or that I'm not a fan myself? I have a feeling you both just like arguing with people, I've had a pretty bad life myself and eminem has helped me in tough times, but I don't go to meet and greets and harass him saying he saved my life and shit. The people who say that have no self-esteem, they don't realize although his music influenced change in their lives, they are the one who made the change. You want to call me a dumbass, or a bitch or criticize me go ahead, it's not going to change the facts or my opinion"
