        "message": "Damn such negativity from some in here, I guess your opinions, I mean judgments, only matter if anyone cares enough ... Personally I think Eminem is evolving beautifully, he\u2019s 45 years old, I can\u2019t speak for him and it\u2019s not my place to but I\u2019m nearly 50 and I\u2019ve been a fan since he first hit our screens, I feel like instead of criticising him for one performance, his appearance, age and whatever else inclusive of political opinions, just leave him be ... I don\u2019t follow someone I\u2019m not really in to as it makes no sense, I\u2019ve better things to do with my time ... My impression is he\u2019s not the same person he was all those years ago when Slim Shady was created, it\u2019s up to him whether he chooses to bring him back or not ... We all age, mature and change as we grow older and Eminem is evolving as he\u2019s growing older ... Who decided there\u2019s an age limit now to rappers? Do you not listen properly to the lyrics in his songs? There\u2019s a massive difference between hearing and truly listening, seeing and truly watching ... Living and learning"
