Encore was his last legitimate high quality album. A lot of people don't like it but it was back when he was hungry and still relevant and young."

            "message": "That's all your opinion. Lyricism still on point. I hated the accent after a while too, I'll give you that, but he's lyrically been just getting better and better from encore up. Looking at it from an MC/rap technique point of view. Taking out any opinion of rather or not you like samples, the use of accents, or whatever other extra shit. I mean really sit down and listen to that MMLP2...Like lyricism so on point it's rediculous. You've got psychopathic killer, asshole, brainless, rap god, legacy, beautiful pain, wicked ways, love game, so much better, evil twin, baby...Bro there's only a couple ones that are weak lyrically (still decent), and those are the singles on the radio. Then you've got his two songs kings never die and phenomenal from the south paw soundtrack, not but 2 years ago. You're not paying attention to the structure of how his shit is put together. Its insane. I write rap/poetry, so I'm familiar with how to construct a rap song and what all goes into, and I challenge you to sit down and write something even half as complex with flawless multiple flows."
