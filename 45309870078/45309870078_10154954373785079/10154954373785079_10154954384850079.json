I\u2019m pretty sure just by looking at you that you did not finish high school and you\u2019re talking about intelligence? You need to be a genius to comprehend things like putting anthrax on tampons, and raping and murdering Christina aguilera etc. Eminem was only good when we were young or pre teens cause of his wacky rebellious lyrics. Last albums have been pathetic and him being sad. Ya ya ya proof died blah blah blah you fuckin Stan\u2019s. I bet you refer to him as Marshall like a goof too. He\u2019s really not that good not even close to the best alive. You stupid stans always refer to rap god for some reason when people say he\u2019s shit. Go listen to a bone thugs album they\u2019ve been rapping fast for 28 years."
