Give TRUE honest unbiased feedback. Relapse was great except for the accent which literally ruined it. Recovery sucked and MMLP 2 was his worst album to date. Rick Rubin is horrible and em should pay dre to work strictly with him and produce all of his tracks. Really em? Berzerk? Rap God (the whack ass beat and corny lyrics which really make no sense)? Phenomenal? The monster? Love the way you lie? Walk on water?  Man, 1999 Eminem would shit on and devote a whole album to shitting on 2017 Eminem. He truly sucks now. I am a true fan which means I cannot be opinionative and 100% honest. He may \"rap\" in his lyrical composition but for all intents and purposes he is truly a \"pop\" star now. I hope his new album proves me wrong and he unloads on it."

            "message": "Brandon you have to pay attention to the lyrics in his music and also his life/career story to appreciate his newer stuff. I don\u2019t listen to much of Relapse,but with MMLP2,that album wasn\u2019t as good musically as the first MMLP. That\u2019s very easy to tell,but it was more meaningful for sure and the references back to the first MMLP are very evident in there. If you know the lyrics in the MMLP songs then you\u2019ll catch all the references in the MMLP2 album. That album is very reflective on his career with songs like Headlights,The Monster,Legacy,etc as well. With Recovery,that was by far Eminem\u2019s most meaningful and lyrical album. Love The Way You Lie,Space Bound,Talkin\u2019 2 Myself,etc. So many meaningful songs. I believe that album also came after both Proof\u2019s death and Eminem\u2019s overdose on Methadone,and the lyrics reflect that experience as well. Every album brings something to the table for Eminem. The recent music brings less humor and more meaning. Are his earlier albums his best albums? No question. Is his recent music bad? No. It\u2019s worse musical quality,but it\u2019s still good. If you continue to compare his recent music to his older and best music,you\u2019re just setting yourself up for disappointment and you won\u2019t understand the beauty of his new music."
