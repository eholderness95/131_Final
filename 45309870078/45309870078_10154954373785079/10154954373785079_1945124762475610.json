        "message": "I found a new curious interest in Eminem. The use of piano and strings against his rap was a different and positive step towards a different destination ? Why does rap have to stay musically stuck in the beat machines or on an overdub on a previous recording ?  Good job on opening up a promising new avenue for rap, that a lot of us are opening their eyes to a different and positive step in a different direction. Glad you blew up the orangatang as well, Em !!!\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e"
