        "message": "People just don't remember who you are Marshall or what you have been through. My 15 year old brother in law told me your newest album was wack. Verbatim. I looked him straight in the eye after I called his name and said \"you are too young to know what the world put slim shady/fireman/cinderellaman and Marshall through. And this criticism is literally going to fuel his fire and he's going to make waves again and you will never forget him for it.\" Lol. No....... not sucking duck but giving kudos where due AND I'm a realist. I could careless if you do not see this but I know the haters and wishers will have this seed in their head forever \ud83d\ude18"
