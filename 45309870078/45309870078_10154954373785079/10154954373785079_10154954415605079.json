But most of you are simple minded and probably angry about his views towards our current president. Eminem is one of, if not the most revered and talented MC's in the field."

If you disagree with Eminem and don\u2019t like his opinions or him in general,that\u2019s your problem,not his. Also,I think that because Eminem is so complex lyrically his messages and song meanings can be hard to understand sometimes. He also has a couple songs (The Monster and Without Me most notably) where the beats and instruments cover up the message of the song. With Walk On Water,neither of those is an issue. Anyone could figure out what Walk On Water is about with one listen. I like that about the song,as well as the content."
