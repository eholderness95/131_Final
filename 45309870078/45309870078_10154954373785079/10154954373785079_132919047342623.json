        "message": "I have this crazy idea. Maybe Revival isn't an album.  Remember how Detox was never released?  The songs  'Kush' and 'I Need A Doctor' were huge hits back in 2011.  Ok, so you listen to the Revival ad and you get the instrumental for 'I Need A Doctor''.  Eminem released a single 'Walk on Water'  It sounds like Eminem is bowing out with that song.  Anyone else see that correlation?  Eminem's 'Revival' started on 11/17.  His retirement perhaps?  Just a crazy idea right."
