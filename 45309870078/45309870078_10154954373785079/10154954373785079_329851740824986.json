I did think the Trump thing 1st was his worse vocals ever which shocked me, never thought those words would come out my mouth.. but love the new song \"walk on water\" I admire him in so many ways but to tell his fans if they don't agree with him on something to fuck off is just down right wrong and he should apologize...it's respect..fans are the ones who buy his music, who supported him regardless of how others got offended so easy, have gave him love and support but again to tell fans to fuck off is just wrong, I sure as fuck don't appreciate it and would think a hell of a lot more of him if he apologized for just those words, it's his business if he thinks Trump sucks but Trump did have his back years ago when he was new .. so in that way it was grimey but again his opinion but for fans to fuck off...just wrong"
