Eminem doesnt care about the politics of it so stop lying to yourselves and saying that is what its about. Its about people who support a piece of shit, greedy conman. He said fuck you to anybody who supports him and i dont give a shit who you are but if you still support Trump at this point, you are either  objectively stupid or too far in denial."
