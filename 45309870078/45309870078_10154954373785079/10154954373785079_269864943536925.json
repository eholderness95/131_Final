        "message": "You are BRILLIANT, always.\n\nPlease help gain exposure for HORSES. Right now the U.S. Senate is deciding whether the BLM should shoot or turn into meat for human consumption over 70,000 American Wild Horses and Burros. The American Mustang is its own breed. Man owes the equine species more than any other species on Earth. They carried us through every battle until the past 70 years. They never complain, are loyal and bear us. Please help stop a few evil men."
