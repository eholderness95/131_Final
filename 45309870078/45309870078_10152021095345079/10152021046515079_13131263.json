In the song 'Criminal' where he says \"drink more liquor that would fuck you up quicker then you'd want to fuck me if I said the word...\" he remains silent, nothing is censored, because he intends to say \"nigger\" but he actually does not say anything - the clue is due to the fact that it rhymes with \"quicker\"."
