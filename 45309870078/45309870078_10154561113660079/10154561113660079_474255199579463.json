        "message": "I dated your D12 DJ Salam back in the early 2000s. He called one day and told me to get my girls together and be would take us somewhere. Of course that day i couldnt get a single one free to hang. I was told by him later that it was a trip to your house i missed out on. I was so bummed. The first time i met him i was at the club waitressing and him and Proof and the rest of the band came in late. To be ho est i didn't know who they were. Lol. Sorry you lost your friend. He seemed real genuine although i only spoke with him that night, he gave out an unforgettably sincere vibe. \n     After meeting them i started listening  to you.  I had never been into rap music but you were different. I went to every concert you had in michigan. I still listen to you. Thank you for just being you and doing what you do!!!"
