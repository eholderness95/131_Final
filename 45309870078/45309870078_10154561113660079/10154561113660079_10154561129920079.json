Montana is one of the most lyrical artist ever, actually sit down and listen to him. Montana is a force to be rekoned with, and em has dropped off a lot as he's aged, unless slim shady actually comes back, and back to his prime (if my original comment is what's going on) Kendrick would be eminems saving factor. Look at Montana's recent music and eminems recent music, listen to the lyrics, and tell me who's better right now. Cus if yo actually do, you'll see rn, Montana is the best rapper out. All respect to em, but in a one v one, unless it's old em Montana would win. Even with old Eminem it would be a battle for the ages"
