I won tickets to the original Up in Smoke tour but, my bitch mom made me sell them because: \"My 15 year old daughter will not be going to hear that shit!\" She would find his cds in my room & break them in half. They always got replaced the next day without her knowledge. LOL\n\nHis music has played a major part in my life & I would love to see him live! There's a song by Simple Plan titled \"This Song Saved My Life\" & that's exactly what Eminem's music did & continues to do for me. Anytime I'm going through some shit, I grab my headphones & mp3 player & do some \"Eminem Therapy\".  \u263a"
