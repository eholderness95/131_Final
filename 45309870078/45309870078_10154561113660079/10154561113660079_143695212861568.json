        "message": "At first I was totally not liking the beard but then I realized he is 2 years older than me. Maybe he's feeling the same thing I am. We are starting to look a little bit older. If I could grow a beard to cover up my expression lines I would. But I'm a woman so I have to try all kinds of face creams to hopefully not look my age. So, Eminem, if the beard makes you feel good keep it. Getting older isn't scary but looking older is. \u2764\ufe0f your Gemini."
