I will never not buy your music as long as you continue to speak about real world issues instead of how many drugs you can take.

I can tell from your comment that you have an egotistical viewpoint on everyone else. When you fail at something it will hit you harder than a freight train barreling down the tracks and there will be no stopping it. Then you will realise just how hard it is to change your state of mind from negative to positive. \n\n I hope that day comes soon. Early enough for you to save yourself, but late enough that you learn that lesson the hard way."
