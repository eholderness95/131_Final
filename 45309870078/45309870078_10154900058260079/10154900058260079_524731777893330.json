        "message": "Well Well! If you know Marshall as u say...then you would know he sings about whats going on at the time of writing his music. If you look back...He sung about his time and break up with Hailey's mum. Then Hailey and recovery. He also says whats on his mind but doesn't mean he would do any of it. A good rapper will rap about real life/experiences/pain/happiness...like all the old school rappers...Hence why I listen to them...Its real n they make u feel their pain n happiness that they rap about. He's not asking for your respect Kaviraj Kalsi! He just sharing his life. You don't like it! don't listen to it :) and yes...thats yelawolfs album \ud83d\ude02 So you possible need more English language class's :) Best of luck ;)"
