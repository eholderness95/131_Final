They're sunk. I feel sorry for people who follow Trump like a salivating dog. Trump is an awful human being, even subhuman. I pray for peace and love to rise up and help the United States. Trump supporters are less than 1% of the world's population and Eminem/Shady/Marshall writes, raps and performs for the whole world. Peace Out! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udfb6 \ud83d\ude0f"
