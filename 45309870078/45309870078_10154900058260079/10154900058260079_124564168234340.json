        "message": "Message for Eminem: I think it was as long ago as 2014... I gave a real cunty comment about your hair looking better blonde. It STILL bothers me that I said that, and I'm way sorry. I'm pretty sure you didn't even notice my dumb comment, but just in case, I want to say that I was wrong. It was judgmental, closed-minded and shitty of me... You're so talented. And you give me and millions of others hope, which is one of the best gifts to give ever. I'm not a \"freak\" fan, but I'm definitely a lifetime fan. So if I am going to say anything, it should be \"Go you!\" - It's almost impossible to do what you have done with your life, but ya did."
