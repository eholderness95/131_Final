            "message": "Eminem has always done songs with pop stars.. Stan, Cum On Everybody, Drug Ballad, Tonite, Business, Superman, Crazy In Love, We Made You to name a few.. also and Em always has had rock inspired beats Lose Yourself, Till I Collapse, Sing For The Moment to name another few.. and also Eminem only had one song on this 21 track album that had a rock inspired beat and that was \"Survival\" and it was sick as fuck.. The only song that had a poppy feel was \"The Monster\" only because of the hook and even though it's the only weak track on the album he still is very lyrical and complex whilst getting his point across and telling the story of his current life.. He is not pop or rock you are just to stubborn and one track minded to see he is not the same person he was on Relapse and Encore.. and also he does not have as much buzz as he used to during the time period of 1999-2004 and he has acknowledged that, so in order for the masses to hear his material and talent he has to have a radio single in order to attract more listeners.. and if you think he \"likes\" pop stars you obviously don't listen to his music and lyrics.. Listen to MMLP2 as a whole before stating such idiotic incoherent banter such as that.."

Infinite although a classic album still can't hold up to the  greatness that is MMLP2.. Now before you get your panties in a bunch: Shady is easily at his best here examples would include Bad Guy (The Perfect Sequel To Stan), Brainless (The Way I Am Vibe and a Sequel to Brain Damage), Rhyme Or Reason (Perfect Flow and Ingenious Rhyme Patterns), Evil Twin (Amazing Concept, Eminem and Slim Shady going back and fourth on each other), So Far (The Happy Go - Lucky Slim Shady and he references back to \"I'm Back\" and \"The Real Slim Shady\" with a very interesting concept), Stronger Than I Was (With a Hailie's Song Vibe, This is from the perspective of Kim Scott responding to songs such as \"Kim\", \"Puke\", \"97' Bonnie and Clyde\" and then at the end states his viewpoint on her), So Much Better (With a \"Kill You\" Concept and a \"Criminal\" Type Beat he is the Happy Go - Lucky and Demented Shady will all love), Survival (A \"Lose Yourself\" Type Beat a \"Til' I Collapse\" Energy and a true \"Marshall Mathers LP\" type of complexity in his rhymes), Berzerk (A Homage to the Beastie Boys with a classic \"The Real Slim Shady\" Type of delivery), Love Game (The Slim Shady Lp type of story telling, funny as hell), Rap God (Bringing the rapid fire lyrics to the radio with an electric type beat meaning he is inhuman or \"Superhuman\" as he states), Legacy (Each Verse shows his growth through childhood, teenage years, and his lookback presently [Slim Shady's perspective].. Also The Reason there is a woman singing the hook signifies Hip - Hop and how it is his savior [As hip - hop is signified as woman]), Asshole (Slim Shady Rapping on an Eminem type track, he disses ICP, Asher Roth and Many Others), Groundhog Day (Amazing Slim Shady Track), Don't Front (Slim Shady on an Infinite type of beat), Baby (A Dr. Dre Type of track [Although not produced by him] he manages to spit technical \"lyrical\" lyrics over a Relapse Beat), Wicked Ways (Great Track, with the return of Ken Kaniff), Beautiful Pain (Toy Soldiers\" and \"Mockingbird\" Feel signifying a relationship with a woman as his relationship with drugs), Desperation (Great Track, No need to go into detail)"
