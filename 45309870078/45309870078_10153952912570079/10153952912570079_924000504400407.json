Like the rest of celebs he supports Clinton and this makes me really frustrated. Not because he doesn't support Trump but because he didn't diss both of them. He's in the same row that Jay Z, Beyonce, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Jlo, Miley Cyrus and other trashy puppets are in and I can't feel this. I remember once he told \"Always be a leader, not a follower\" and now he's gonna do the same shit that he did 4 and 8 yrs ago by voting. I'd rather follow someone like George Calvin who had never given a shit about ellection cause he wasn't a puppet."
