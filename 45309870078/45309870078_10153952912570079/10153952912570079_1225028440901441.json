The cause is \"greedy\" military interventions. Religion is used as \"brainwashing\" on both sides. We can end the war and actually prevent Terrorism if we change our foreign policy and use more diplomacy.\n\nThe outsourcing of U.S. jobs and illegal immigration are caused by foreign trade policy that focuses on business interests at the expense of workers' rights and environment protection. We don't have to build a wall. The answer is trade policy that gradually increase wages and regulations abroad not lowers them here."

Go press re-play, he delivered you material for a life time. Stop whining and making demands, he doesn't own you anything. I'm constantly amazed at the lack of substance in the comments on this page... It seems many of you use Eminem as a drug - may I suggest you actually use it as an inspiration? Like get up, turn up the sound and do your OWN thing?... Pay him tribute in the most authentic way, by pulling YOUR dicks out of the dirt on the soundtrack... Be a fan, not a nuisance. Or, in the words of John Steinbeck: \"The object of love is the best and most beautiful. TRY TO LIVE UP TO IT.\""
