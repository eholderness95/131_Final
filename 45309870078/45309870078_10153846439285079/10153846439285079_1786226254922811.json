        "message": "Eminem  ...Wondering if you ever jump on here and read these comments..Would be cool if you did.. I think you have inspired so many & helped others get through their life events, it would be cool for you to see that thru all the positive vibing posts. Anyways just wanted to wish you a very Happy Birthday.. I was first introduced to your music when I was 19 turning 20...You were just 27 & you're first hit hadn't even dropped was just about to though...It was right before you became famous & blew-up as an artist.We were in the same location in March 99', so much fun.  Now I have been rocking your music for 17 years, almost 2 Decades of Eminem, Unbelievable !!!..Ive watched you grow & progress as an artist & remain in awe of your raw talent since day one & of your ability to use/manipulate words...I've followed your journey of both your highs & lows.. My wish is to cross paths with you in this life & one day actually meet you...though I'd probably not even know what to say, from the shock factor...From one extemely loyal fan, wishing you the happiest 44th possible! Keep doing what you do best...This world needs you... <3"
