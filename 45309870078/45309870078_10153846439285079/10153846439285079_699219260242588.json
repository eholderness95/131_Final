        "message": "44 years of so much lived thing. 44 years of hassles, pain, sadness, disappointment, and suffering; but a lot of laughs, smiles, joys and satisfactions too.\n\nYou came into my life when i was on my 12 years old, and you never ever left after that. You came into my little heart and made of it an eternal abode.\n\nJust who really is a fan, and really knows your life, your history and your career can judge you. And on my part I can only say: I will never ever leave you... no matter what!!!\n\nThat God can always keep the front of your ways, guiding and illuminating each one of your steps, taking you on His lap when necessary, and blessing you (and everyone around you) every single day!!!\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY B, i love you!!!!"
