Ford Focus Electric goes 110 miles per charge!!!2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV, with an all electric range of 238 miles! Follow Chevrolet Electric for Volt and Bolt news. Chevrolet Volt is the electric car with a backup plan. It runs on an electric charge and generates additional electric power through a gas-powered generator when the battery runs out \u2014 giving you the confidence to go as far as you want. Volt has an electric range of 53 miles, the gas generator kicks on after that to bring the total range to 420 miles. With Volt you can make most trips with no gas needed, but you can still go far if you need to by using a little bit of gas. The BMW i3 is available in two versions depending on your mobility needs. The purely electric BMW i3 gets up to 114 miles per charge while the BMW i3 with Range Extender gets up to 180 miles in total range. Tesla has the best Electric Cars by far(Very fast acceleration, High Tech, Very Safe, 265 mile range standard and 315 optional), but they are much more expensive until the Model 3 arrives in 2018. Tesla has a nice lease offer if it's too expensive to buy. Tesla leases Rooftop Solar Panels, and Solar integrated Roofs for your Home. Tesla sells a PowerWall battery system used to store your solar power for use at night. Rayton Solar's new technology will reduce the cost of making quality Solar Panels, so more people can afford them."
