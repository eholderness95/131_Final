It's 14 years gone since I heard you for the first time, I was a kid a real youth kid should have probably 8 or 9 years old in this balance (I don 't remember the month), whatever... The reason why I am here it's not just to wish you happy birthday or congratulations, no. I am here to thank you in name of all your fans who found, who find and will find a safe world in your songs cuz you're make us feel that, you have made your history, your songs are your legacy. I am here to thank you for the strength you've given to people who hear you not only your fans, I wanna thank you for being you, for showing to us that life isn't ended when the world crash you down. I wanna thank you for a lot of things so long to describe I 'm finishing with this expression... HAVE A HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! And THANK YOU FOR BEING YOU... Eminem"
