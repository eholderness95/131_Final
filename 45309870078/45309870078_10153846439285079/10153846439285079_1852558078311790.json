If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\n\n16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.\n\n17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever."
