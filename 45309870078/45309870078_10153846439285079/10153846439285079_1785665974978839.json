Your music helped me to endure all that shit what I experienced, you're still with me your favorite rapper. You are my own rap career inspiration, I respect you a lot and I would sometimes see a gig in Finland. I'll post the attached Lose Yourself which has helped my own during my career a lot\n\nPs and HBD MY TRUE KING\n\nPlz like my comment if u read this"
