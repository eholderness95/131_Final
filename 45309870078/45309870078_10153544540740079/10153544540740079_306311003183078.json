        "message": "When I say neglect I don't mean we were sitting around in actual sh.t but who knows. Our mom was never home we had a babysitter but their dad would come home and be angry and dismiss the babysitter and take his anger out on us. Our mom purposely didn't come home because she was unhappy she was never home and she knew their dad was abusive because we would call her at work and she would tell us not to call her at work. They used to not feed us often and forget to pick us up from school, our clothes were always dirty which us why cps got called one time I think. They didn't keep barely any food In the house sometimes they would lock us out of the house or make us sleep on the cold hard wood floors with no blankets or clothes. They just were weird they did weird things that didn't make sense... it was a weird kind of abuse and they are still crazy af and don't know it... and these are the people that I am supposed to go to for support in life... so when people see me in a sh.t ass situation they think I am a piece of sh.t they don't understand I am a prodigy based on what I've been through I should be shooting up in a ditch somewhere unable to read or tie my f.cking shoes."
