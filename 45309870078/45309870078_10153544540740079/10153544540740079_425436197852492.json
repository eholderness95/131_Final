        "message": "My mom always told me feminism was a conspiracy made up by the government to force women to go to work so the government could tax twice as many people and have an economy twice the size. Well we know now it is a necessary evil for women to make their own income and not be dependant on others because they can be abused if put into that position. I think there needs to be a third option however because now other people raise our children even though some of us want to do it or can do it for cheaper or the same price they won't let us they'd rather pay a 3rd party and cause the child to have developmental and attachment issues. In some cases we can't work while being single parents because our children may have special needs. In many cases we are unable to find jobs period with the economy the way it is and jobs outsources...or jobs that are sufficient enough to support us without a man or second income."
