        "message": "Anyway the house isn't the reason for the crime occurring it's just an opportunity to facilitate a crime... the crime already exists in someone's poor or dysfunctional psychology. Crimes are acted out whether or not a particular location exists because a person is looking to create a crime than another opportune place to commit that crime with reveal it's self at some point. The real problems are psychological and exist in mental world before they ever reach the physical world.. this country is pretty inadequate to deal with mental illness though so it goes undiagnosed and untreated which could prevent alot of crime."
