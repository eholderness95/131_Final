Encore was good and then the rest was average, including SSLP although I will say SSLP had a few songs on there that I love to this day."

Don't get me wrong though, he still shines Lyrically to this day, but it is crazy how his flow has changed so much since he quit the drugs. SSLP is easily my favourite album, and MMLP has that angsty vibe that I loved so much as a teen. Despite everything though, he still continues to reinvent himself and push his sound forward, and u can't really ask more of an Artist than that!"
