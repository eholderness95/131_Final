        "message": "When your own parents neglect or abuse you it's kind of weird. It's like you were kidnapped and abused only no one cares and you have no family to go back to. You just walk around traumatized like no one knows where I just came from it's like you are a Ferrell child who crawled out of a cave and have a hard time adjusting to regular life and how other peoples families work so you develop really bad social anxiety.. I still have it mostly it is because I am not able to deal with alot of bad stuff that happens to me alone rather than just being uncomfortable around other people."
