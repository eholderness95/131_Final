For me, nobody touches Eminem on a technical & lyrical level.  The man bends the language to suit him and what he's rapping about at the time.\n\nAnd I won't get Curtain Call because it's essentially a greatest hits cd with a few extra unreleased songs & some of my more fave Eminem songs aren't/weren't hits."
