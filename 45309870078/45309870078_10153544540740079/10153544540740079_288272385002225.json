        "message": "They're more likely to die than to stop lying to themselves as we can see it's been over 30 years and no remorse. Their dad reminds me of the guy who is stalking me now that I just had to call the police on. He reminds me so much of him it's why I can't stand him besides him being abusive and nuts. He is very very charming like my siblings dad was... as you can see they abused and neglected us and they are so good looking and charming no one cares."
