        "message": "There's no ability to change a pattern unless you recognize it. I try to change the patterns but this by far isn't easy because it's a personal affair. If patterns are not recognized they can never be resolved and they keep reoccurring throughout history through other people. Like the guy who raped the girl in 8 mile then he was crazy and came back to the home and got caught... 15 years or so later there's a real case of that here with Coltons dad because the mental health issues never got recognized or taken care of which would have maybe eradicated the problem over a decade ago."
