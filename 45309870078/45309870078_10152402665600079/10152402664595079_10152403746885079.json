        "message": "I don't quite understand the disapointment of few of you. It's a Shady Records anniversary album. Eminem's work is not all about him rapping, but also him producing other. And with some big commercial hits like 50cent. Have you ever seen Em release two solo albums two years in a row? Futhermore, a double CD? Moreover, when Shady XV had been announced, it was said to be a CD of hits and a CD of new materials, and that's what we got here. So shut the fuck up, listen and enjoy."
