        "message": "When you caught my eye for the first time,\nMy world stood still for a little while.\nThis feeling I cant explain,\nHow you took my breath away.\nI wondered if you knew, \nWhat I was going through.\nIf you felt the same way,\nOr am I going insane?\nIt's like you reached into my soul,\nGiving me that old Rock-and-Roll.\nI can feel it in the beat,\nKnowing that you're next to me.\nYou help take away the pain,\nSay good-bye to my yesterday.\nBaby you've shown me the light,\nLove is blind but you gave me back sight...\nPut your heart next to mine. -Love Ash"
