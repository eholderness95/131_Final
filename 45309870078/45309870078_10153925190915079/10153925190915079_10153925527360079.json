        "message": "Hello,\n\nI am Zolty Bogata, a Romanian blogger with locomotor disabilities. I am starting this fundraiser to help other people with locomotor disabilities who cannot afford to buy electric wheelchairs.\n\nAll the money raised in this humanitarian campaign are used to buy used electric wheelchairs for those in need.\n\nAlso, this campaign is supported by many Romanian bloggers, and you can read about it on this article: http://zoltybogata.ro/imi-poti-ceda-un-loc-de-bener-pe-blogul-tau   https://www.youcaring.com/people-with-locomotor-disabilities-653838\n\nAny amount of money can make the life easier for those less fortunate.\n\nThank you,\nZolty Bogata"
