Listen to what is being revealed, you understand that i don't appeal. But it doesn't matter what you feel.\nIf you've got something to say promise me it's real.\nI just wanted to make you witness the storm\nI'm sitting out of bounds i'm the hive mind from the swarm\nA still alive mine-field ready and reborn\nDon't walk across it or you'll wake up in your dorm\nAnd i'm just about to get you to stop sleeping on the set\nWe record"
