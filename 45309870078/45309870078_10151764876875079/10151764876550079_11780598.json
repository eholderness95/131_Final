        "message": "[Intro]\nLook, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings\nBut I'm only going to get this one chance\nSomething's wrong, I can feel it (For six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)\nJust a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen\nBut I don't know what if that means what I think it means\nWe're in trouble, big trouble\nAnd if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances\n(You are just what the doc ordered)\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox\nThey said I rap like a robot, so call me rapbot\n\n[Verse 1]\nBut for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes\nI got a laptop in my back pocket\nMy pen'll go off when I half-cock it\nGot a fat knot from that rap profit\nMade a living and a killing off it\nEver since Bill Clinton was still in office\nWith Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nut-sack\nI'm an MC still as honest\nBut as rude and as indecent as all hell\nSyllables, skill-a-holic (kill em all with)\nThis flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop\nYou don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap\nPacking a Mac in the back of the Ac\nBackpack rap crap, yep, yep, yackity-yak\nAnd at the exact same time\nI attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that\nI'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table\nOver the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half\nOnly realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact\nHow could I not blow, all I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack\nRappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad\nIt's actually disastrously bad for the wack\nWhile I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece (Yeah)\n\n[Bridge]\nCause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox\nLet me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard\nEverybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance\nEverybody loves to root for a nuisance\nHit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since\nMC's get taken to school with this music\nCause I use it as a vehicle to 'bus the rhyme'\nNow I lead a new school full of students\nMe, I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac\nN.W.A, Cube, Hey Doc, Ren Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim\nInspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position\nTo meet Run DMC, induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'\nRoll Hall of Fame\nEven though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames\nOnly Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame\nOn the wall of shame\nYou fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames\nOff a plank, and tell me what in the fuck are you thinking\nLittle gay lookin' boy\nSo gay I can barely say it with a straight face lookin', boy\nYou witnessing a massacre\nLike you watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy\nOy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking, boy\nYou get a thumbs up, pat on the back\nAnd a way to go from your label everyday lookin', boy\nHey, lookin' boy, what you say lookin' boy\nI get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre lookin', boy\nI'ma work for everything I have\nNever ask nobody for shit, get outta my face lookin' boy\nBasically boy you're never gonna be capable\nTo keeping up with the same pace lookin', boy\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nThe way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar\nDale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God\nKneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent\nLet off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'\nAnd I should not be woken\nI'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating\nBut I got your mom deep throating\nI'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle\nI'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil\nIt's me, my honesty's brutal\nBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though\nFor good at least once in a while\nSo I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle\nEnough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times\nBut I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned\nRappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime\nI know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground\nBut I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\nSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\nAppeal with the skin color of mine\nYou get too big and here they come trying to censor you\nLike that one line I said on \"I'm Back\" from the Mathers LP\nOne when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine\nSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was\nBut I'm morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal\nYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows\nYou write normal, fuck being normal\nAnd I just bought a new ray gun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\nCause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather\u2019s pad\nSingin' to a man while they played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day\n\"Hey Fab, I'mma kill you\"\nLyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)\nUh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber\nSo that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you\nI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating\nCause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\nOh, he's too mainstream\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\nIt's not hip-hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it\n\"I don't know how to make songs like that, I don't know what words to use\"\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I\u2019m ripping any one of these verses, that versus you\nIt\u2019s curtains, I\u2019m inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to prove\nThat if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins to\nSchool flunkie, pill junky\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues\nBut it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat\nBumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky but funky\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and here's what they want from me\nThey're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had\nThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handin' you lemons, make lemonade then\nBut if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then\nDon't mistake him for Satan\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\nAnd take a vacation to trip abroad\nAnd make her fall on her face and don't be a retard\nBe a king? Think not \u2013 why be a king when you can be a god"
