        "message": "The video was definatly not what I was expecting but its by far the best video I've seen since Not Afraid :) In this song he says \"I aint as big as I was\" So he clearly believes he has already passed his peak years ago. Personally I believe his peak will never be reached. His music just gets better and better as the years go by because the amazing story of his life in his music gets bigger and better. Love this legend."
