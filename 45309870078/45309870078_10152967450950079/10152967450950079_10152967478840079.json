Just a bunch of pussies taking about all their materialistic crap, sluts they fuck and every city on the map. You don't have to be smart to rhyme some words, but you have to be 'controversial' if you want to be heard.\n\nThere's a freestyle for you idiots. Rap sucks. Listen to some real music, ya know, that wasn't dubbed, recycled from the 80s and shouted over by some man child with sagging pants and bad teeth."
