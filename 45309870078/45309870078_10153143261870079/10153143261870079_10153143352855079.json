He should have played spider man in my opinion whoever chose tobey was probly tobey's boyf . ... Anyway now about the music , yes M you keeeled it man ... Loved \"phenomenal\"  some dumbfucks was saying on YouTube you don't talk sense no more ... I'm thinking what bathsalts was those weird dudes on , you only just teaching someone to be phenominal , nothing much .... Anyway \"Kings Neva Die \" also the bomb-track ... Gwen was the dead right one for that .. Was that track a bit of a dig a RA the rugged on one level ? Mr YouTube yet anti media ... Maybe I'm just being nasty here . Anyway well done guys ANOTHER succes , damn some mthrfckrs just got the Midas touch ;)"
