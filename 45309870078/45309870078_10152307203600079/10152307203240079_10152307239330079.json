        "message": "Who knows for all we know \"fuck school\" a reference to White America and he's just reminding us that we're in the real world and people aren't gonna constantly encourage the way our school system functions or education as a whole, because there are other routes, just look at Em. Or he's just saying what everyone is thinking lol. Just because he writes \"fuck school\"doesn't mean students are going to drop out and stop trying, but in some regards students do in fact get angered at their education at points, and Em is just personifying that feeling. I've listened to Eminem since I was 13 and I'm doing just fine education wise at Syracuse University. I think people need to calm down and those who are truly intelligent won't be coerced through his lyrics, but rather appreciate what Em's doing and why he's doing it."
