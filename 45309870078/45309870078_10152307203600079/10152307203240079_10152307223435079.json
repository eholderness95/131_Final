What idiotic pandering to a generation of \"anti-establishment-wannabe -thugs\". I know school isn't easy for everyone but come on Marshall. Come on. Fuck School? Really? Fuck the greatest FREE public education system in the world, that has to meet the needs of the most diverse population ever brought together in the history of the planet? All I can do is roll my eyes at this, because I'm sure he doesn't even believe it. If his daughter was a dropout, as a father, I'm sure he would have been disappointed. This isn't even \"keeping it real\", it's just keeping it stupid."

I went to a school with teachers an above average amount of teachers that truly knew their stuff and taught REALLY well and I still laughed like you wouldn't believe at that comment. If you're harboring the delusion that our schools and teachings aren't full of brain washing then I worry for the children. The idea of standardized school and dragging children along that really can't keep up is a farce in itself. To give myself a bit of credibility; I had straight A's in all advance placement classes while sleeping my way through the majority of them and that speaks for itself but I also participated in programs that allowed me to go to other schools, larger schools with larger budgets, and can definitely say I went to a very good school comparatively. I have an above average intelligence but I'm far from a genius. Fuck School not education."

Fact is, a lot of the negative associations you have with your time at school are actively being reformed and changed. It's a slow going process nation wide, but mostly because education reform is handled state-by-state for the most part. I don't want to get into a back and forth on facebook because that seems silly. But I would encourage you to look into the new and exciting ways teachers are now engaging their students. Or, you can stay cynical and oppositional for fun.
