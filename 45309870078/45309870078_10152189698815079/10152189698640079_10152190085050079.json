        "message": "Those there will agree, the show as a whole was fucking amazing. Though Wembley didn't do it Justice, the soundsystem for anyone in the croud was awful, too much bass up front and it distorted the sound which was coming from behind us, pointing in the other direction... Sounded really bad... Which is a shame because the show was brilliant!"
