        "message": "I DESPERATELY NEED YOUR HELP EM....I have searched and search for anyway to contact you or anyone that could contact you.  I am in a bind right now: I have unfortunately split with no joke the absolute best thing in my life.  My lady and I decided a couple months back to take a break.  Didn't last long and we are slowly trying to kick things back into a forward gear which is awesome.  Her birthday is coming up and you are bar none this girls favorite thing on the planet.  She is an outstanding person and makes me a better man.  Her birthday is coming up on the 30th and I have contemplated anyways to incorporate you into some type of present...card board cut out, put your face on a cake, hoodies, etc...you name it and I have probably thought it was a good idea.  I am truly asking for some genuine help getting the love of my life back and if somehow or someway I could involve some type of surprise from you...I don't know what which is why I am asking for help.  I have watched so many people come and go in my life and for the first time I do not want to see this one go...hope this somehow reaches you\nThanks, \nMason"
