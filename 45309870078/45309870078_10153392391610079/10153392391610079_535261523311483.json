        "message": "You are a guy that helped put courage into our hearts and helped our heads be strong.  Your words lifted my sons head when he needed lifting from the ignorant looks he recieved from ignorant people.  You gave my son a reason to fight everything wrong in this world.  He suffered from cancer for over 5 years.... in pain and heartache,  but still loved every minute of life.  He managed to share all the love he had within himself to many. He managed to share the reason to live. And he was able to request a song by you on a local radio station which they happily played for him. To that song \"Ricky Lee\" (drift car driver) put a video clip together for us to remember and cherish. Much love to you Ricky! Much love to everyone who cared for my son. And much love to you dear Angel for expressing the emotions some of us feel and know about. You helped fix my boys wings so he could fly again.  \u2665"
