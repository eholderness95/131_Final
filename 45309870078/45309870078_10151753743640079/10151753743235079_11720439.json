        "message": "You people do understand that when Proof died so did D12. And in all actualality so did Slim Shady. The only song from the MMLP2 that could be considered a Slim Shady song is Berzerk. Encore was the cliff and Relapse was the fall and the end of the Slim Shady era in Eminems career. Recovery was the resurrection of Eminem and the MMLP2 is his legacy and story of who Marshall Mathers is."
