        "message": "Dana Alan Butler your an idiot.. either you dont know your rap education or you simple dont think while typing.\nIm the early 90s.. any rapper who was white was classified as a wannabe balck guy.. hell even dr. Dre thought eminem was black when he first heard his mix tape. In the generation.. being white and rapping was grounds for being killed. Sure they may have been white rappers.. but none would dare to expose them selves to a black dominated industry.\n\nSecondly, eminem is by far the best rapper alive.. the guy is untouchable in todays industry.. i dont care how many underground white rappers or black rappers their are.. not one will be able to rap like eminem.. not one. The industry knows not to fuck wuth him. Know your shit before opening your mouth"
