        "message": "Money mayweather are you waiteing for Pac man to get older slower and unable to fight in his prime! Cause that's how it looks! A good champ doesn't pick and choose a true champ allows the fight to go ahead regardless or race, creed and ability. He look s for a champ to fight. Not that I discredit those you have fought, but you have certainly gone every which way to dismiss , dodge and excuse yourself from him. Do us all a favor and fight the good fight!"
