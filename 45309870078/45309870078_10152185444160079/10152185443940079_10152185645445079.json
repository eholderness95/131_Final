        "message": "I was sat in a refuge for beaten women with my babies when I first ever heard the song Stan, I have been a fan of Eminem ever since, my teenage daughter now also looks upto Eminem her perspective another kid with a rotten father, anyway cutting a long story short it was on our bucket list to see Eminem in concert together and it was so emotional for us to see how far we had gotten in the years since Stan. Eminem is a reminder to us to keep fighting, and we are \"beautiful\" too. Eminems gig at Wembley was a once in a lifetime, Epic, super experience and we wish Marshal Mathers the peace he has brought to us ."
