        "message": "So many people complained that they couldn't hear him Friday, seriously what the fuck! I was right near the front I could hear and I've seen people's vids at different areas of the stadium and still perfect sound! The guardian paper say we should get our money back. I don't want my money back! Eminem delivered the best! It was one night I will never forget. I'd waited since a kid to see the legend himself and finally I did and to top it off saw another legend too. Still feels like a dream! Only thing I wish I could complain about is i wish you could have been on longer haha! Please don't let it be another decade till you come back to london eminem we fucking love you!"

That being said I had the most amazing night. he didn't disappoint me one bit, but the arena did, also the screens where out by at least 2 seconds which was slightly annoying! Wembley need to sort it out."
