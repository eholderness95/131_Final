        "message": "Hi Em (if you ever see this) I would love confirmation if you ever do even if it's literally someone running your Facebook simply messaging me over private message saying \"he's seen this\" if at all poss but I was there last night at Wembley & I just feel I need to show you my status I literally just wrote before coming on your page, anyway, sorry I chat shit when I'm nervous!!\n....I feel today like I'm on the start of a new journey in my life, it's like the rap god himself has come & saved me, the buzz I still feel from seeing that incredible man & pure talent of an artist (Dre too ofc! \ud83d\udc97)  still sends shivers all over my body (nice shivers), his songs (especially \"sing for the moment\", \"til I collapse\", \"not afraid\" & \"lose yourself\" especially) have made me feel for the first time in years like I can make a better life for me, my man & my babies Tobias Jackson & Marshall Cain. \nI just need to start believing in me. I hope you all don't mind me sharing this & I also sorta hope nobody's like \"STFU BITCH\" coz I really do feel I'm finally on the \"positivity path\" of life & it feels so DAMN GOOD! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n\nI live forever grateful to #Eminem #WembleyStadium #July12 #DrDre \ud83d\udc97\u2b50\ufe0f\ud83d\udc97\n\nI love you so much, always \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f xxxx"
