Whether you like him or not he is a legend - thats not opinion , thats a fact - Best selling artist of the 2000's , one fo the highest selling male artists both digital and physical , 13 grammy's , several testimonies from several magazines with several music critics rating him as one of the best. \"iF YOU HAPPEN TO LISTEN TO HIS SONGS ITS LIKE A GIRL IS RAPPING\" That is a very stupid comment , and im not insulting you , I am saying it is literally a stupid comment, what girls rap like that, how many songs have you listened to? List the themes he raps about that sound like that? Dont get surprised when people respond harshly , Its what you get when you say a legend \"aint no rap shit\""
