        "message": "Slim I have always worshiped u as my god... I love u bro.... Listening to ur music I have learnt the real meaning of rap... It isnt bout making music, it is how u see the world and how u represent urself ... I don't understand ppl think its bout talking how many bitches they've got or how big they are or their wealth... Its bout knowing ur ppl, showing them their right position and making ur own outta dis world... I worship every word u say... And I wish someday I get to rap with u... Love u bro.. Fuck The Free World.....  Respect to Nas & tupac shakur (2pac)."
