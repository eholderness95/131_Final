It's new!\nAnd the smell in the room fir\nLights and garlands bright,\nAnd the anticipation of gifts \u2014\nAll this holiday features.\nSo let dreams come true!\nAll the best, good, warmth, good luck,\nHealth and to it to boot\nThe charge of vivacity and strength.\nThat year only bring happiness!\n\u00a9"
