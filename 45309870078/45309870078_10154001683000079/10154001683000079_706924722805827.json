        "message": "@Eminem I would like you to know that I may not be in the position just yet, but one day, whether you're old as f*ck or in the next year or two, I plan to be famous enough to sit down and have a conversation with you. I think its amazing and really awesome you're as famous as you are, but I also know that you're just a person, a human being who has gone through a lot of sh*t and writing/rapping lyrics has made you famous... Why the hell not?! Your talent of rapping and writing has made you a celebrity but none of that will make you less of a human. We'll chat in person later, I know this. (Not an obsessed fan, just someone who can relate) see you later!"
