She died in an alley way at twenty two years of rage. The reason why I'm telling you this man is not only because I'm a slim shady fan, but it's also because if Marilyn Mansons manager who I'm going to call up tomorrow to talk to about a game I've been creating titled: Marilyn Mansions doesn't decide to help me out, you may be my only other option or hope of getting somewhere of getting famous or discovered if I have any hope at all of getting anywhere."
