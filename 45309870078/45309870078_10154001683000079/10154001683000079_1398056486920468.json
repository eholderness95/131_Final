        "message": "For those of you who have misunderstood my comment re the clothing line please don't bother sending me comments about how I think I can do a better job, if you look at my name you can see immediately I'm female, so I can't possibly \"the lad\" I referred to as having artistic DESIGN ability. It should be clear I was knocking the RETAILER, if not you would surely know that when a RETAILER wants to lift sales, whether it be clothing or perfume, they create designs or perfumes, invite the CELEBRITY to view, comment, put in personalised touches etc. Could you imagine Beyonc\u00e9 or Nikki Minaj sitting in a lab creating perfume? Lastly, why would I be a FAN and then pour out hate? EMINEM is popular Downunder as well you know!"
