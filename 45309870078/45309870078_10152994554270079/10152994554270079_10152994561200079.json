Like i said, white dudes keep listening eminem and they think they know shit about hip hop...let me tell you something, you don't know nothing ok?? You just put your cap back, air jordans in your feet, you just listen some eminem tracks and you think you know all about hip hop and rap?? Think again...just think again...Before you tell me eminem is the best, go check some classic. Eminem is better than most of s**** rappers we have know...drake, lil wayne (not the old lil wayne..the old lil wayne/in tha carter 2 was a beast!!) or others. But for me, and for most of real hip hop fans, Eminem is a top 5 rapper, but not the best...Immortal T, Wu tang, Rakim, Nas, Kendrick, etc etc..they are among hip hop most valuable rappers...and i'm tired..tired to hear that coming from 12-15 years old white dudes.....poor hip hop :("
