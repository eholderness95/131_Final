        "message": "This past Monday we had our 2nd annual fundraiser for the Vermont trip we will be taking with our youth, and it was so much fun!! Lots of new and familiar faces came out to support many of our talented young artists and with all of your support we've already raised 924 dollars! If you are interested in supporting our trip to Vermont you can donate online at https://www.zumix.org/donate, donate to our crowdrise page at https://www.crowdrise.com/zumixsummerof\u2026/fundraiser/zumixinc, come by any weekday between 12-8pm, or send in a check labeled ZUMIX Vermont Trip. Every little bit helps! Thank you!\n\nhttps://www.crowdrise.com/zumixsummerof\u2026/fundraiser/zumixinc"
