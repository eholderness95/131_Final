He is a producer, rapper, singer, songer writer, and musician. He plays the piano and guitar. He just released an album on his own and I would like to help him in any way possible. I was wondering if we can work something out with his music and possibly support him with this album. This song is called \"Rich off music\" please tell me what you think or a simple post would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully Ricardo. We are not asking for money. We are asking for an opportunity to get recognized by someone who can potentially make a difference in his career."
