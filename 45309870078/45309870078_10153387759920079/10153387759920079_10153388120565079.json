        "message": "A man at 40 years old can't be rapping about drugs, killing people, it would seem stupid, plus he hasn't got the anger anymore. Em is different, he raps how he feels, all his albums have different feelings and that is how he feels at that time in his life. SSLP- doesn't give a fuck about anything in life, MMLP- angry, Eminem Show - shows that he's a piss taker even when he can be angry at the same time, Encore- he feels fucked up, relapse- telling how he felt when going through drugs, Recovery- starting to get back together and feeling more normal, MMLP- he actually feeling more normal than ever and loves it. For me that's pretty amazing because with every song and album it's a story of his life. Don't diss his new stuff, the mans a legend."
