PLEASE TELL ME WHAT MAKES HIM SO GREAT??? I've been listening to hip hop for 36 yrs and over that time, It's my opinions that LL, Biggie, Nas and Snoop are the 4 most overrated rappers in the history of hip hop.\n\nI just don't get what makes this guy so \"great\".. His lyrics are sub-par, his flows are sub-par, he's no activist like a 2pac or a Nas, and honestly, Ja Rule got slammed on by people for making R&B but, LL was doing that shit LOOONG before Ja and nobody's ever said shit about THAT. (not that I'm supporting Ja, just pointing out the hypocrisy).\n\nAnyway, I'll just never get LL's popularity. *throws on his Makaveli record*"
