He said that if you sound the same on your next album as you did on your last album, then you're failing as an artist. I think Em has stayed true to his words. He doesn't really sound or rap exactly the same on any two albums, with the exception of Encore and Curtain Call, and Curtain Call doesn't really count. I think MMLP2 was just such a big leap from what he was on Recovery that it was a little hard to swallow, but the more i listen to it the more i appreciate what he did with it. I pretty much only listen to Eminem, and it feels like i'm listening to 8 different artists."
