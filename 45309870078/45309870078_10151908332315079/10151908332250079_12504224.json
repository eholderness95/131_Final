        "message": "What the fuck, recovery wasn't about him \"leaving the illuminati\" it was about his life struggles and the shit he was going through, not to mention past shit that he never got to cover or explain. If you don't like his new shit then shut the fuck up and stop talking about it, nobody fucking cares about your opinion or horrible music taste. There's a reason he still has millions of fans and it's not from putting out shitty music. This motherfucker works his ass off to give you the best. If you want drugs go do them your damn self and put out a record. No one in the rap game is even on his level and if his rhymes, similes and metaphors are too much for you to handle then you obviously haven't understood what he's been doing since he first started in the rap game. All he does is rap, so just leave it at that and shit the fuck up"
