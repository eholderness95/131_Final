It has him with out the mic cause he cant say what he wants to say anymore and his demon holding the mic to show that hes being controlled by the illuminati. He wanted out of the rap game after the eminem show and encore after he went hard at the illuminati and they killed Proof. Now hes trapped like he also shows in the music video for Monster"
