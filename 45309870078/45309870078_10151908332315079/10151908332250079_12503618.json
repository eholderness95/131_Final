        "message": "Eminems music is not devil worship Amber. He raps with total emotion, he feels his music and you can feel it when you listen to it. Yes he's tormented but far from devil worship. We are all tormented by something and the people that love his music relate to him on some level or another. Don't put people down for liking his music. That's not being a Christian, you have no right to judge anything he does or anyone else for that matter. If you don't like his music, DONT FUCKING LISTEN TO IT"
