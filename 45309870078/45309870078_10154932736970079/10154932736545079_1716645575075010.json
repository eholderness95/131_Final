There hasn't been a war that wasn't manufactured for lining the pockets of politicians and the mega wealthy for years and years. I get it. You believe in fighting for our freedoms and rights and the American way. And I applaud your intentions. But if you can't see that Trump who is a spoon fed never had to struggle for anything in his life and privileged enough to get out of what you were willing to do....service to his county....well, you are pissed at the wrong person. Be angry because you are about to see Trump cut funding and taxes for everyone except his extremely wealthy ass kissing buddies and himself. Be angry because kids go to bed hungry. Be angry because money can keep you out of prison , not justice. Be angry for the right reasons, not because you want to compare your life to someone else's and try to make yourself out to be better."

Who was putting the US at risk so badly that Karl needed to go protect your freedoms? No one. Your freedoms and the idea that they are ever at risk from any other country are some of the biggest, most ruthlessly effective ways for you to be controlled. You invade others, literally throwing American lives away under false pretenses, and it's exactly what the system wants. Can't get volunteers without blind obedience and excessive patriotism. It's all rather silly really :)."

We went because we volunteered to serve the nation. It is a selfless act. I do not normally draw attention to that but i am not normally attacked for my service. Granted commenting in this page about mather's brain dead attempt at politics has incited a few libtards to opine, i had expected as much.\nThe truth is mather's attempted to normalize that knaperdick sob and all those little cry baby nfl \"players\" that have chose to spit on the graves of our fallen soldiers as they spit on their country as well. Denying that shit with some dumb ass dr suess rap is fucking moronic.\nHis new song sucks too.\nMathers actually sucks dick.\nBeyounce has a good voice but her lines are cheezy as fuck.\nComplete waste of talent. It will probably be all over the radio and force fed to the mainstream idiots but the truth is it is fucking horrible.\nBut i digress.\nMathers is a dope smoking punk who degrades women, he degrades himeself, and now attemptz to degrade me. I have every right to tell thst little piece of shit off.\nId do it in person but the little pussy might bring that gay ass westside story gang of his and breakdown into a showtune dance to am i pretty.\nMathers would cry like a little girl in my prezence. I seriously doubt he wants me in his face.\nMathers is a little pussy with a big mouth, i guess from sucking all those big (edit)icks"
