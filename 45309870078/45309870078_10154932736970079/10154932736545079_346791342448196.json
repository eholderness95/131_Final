The dude has moved on from what he said so why can't y'all stop being crybabies and do the same? No matter what you guys say, the dude is not gonna change his thoughts on Trump. Get over it and move on."

All I'm saying is that you guys said what you had to say. Yeah it's cool to state your opinion. THAT'S FINE. But when you're constantly going on and on and on about how your oh-so-favorite artist drew a line days ago on a post that ain't got shit to do with Trump, it's annoying and honestly pointless. Eminem ain't talkin' about Trump anymore in any of his posts now is he? He's doing his OWN thing and releasing an album next week. The BET Hip Hop Awards been over and people stopped talking about it. Move the fuck on and stop being crybabies just because your artist drew a line. What's done is done. Move on. There are plenty of other artists to listen to."

At the end of the day, Em is sticking by what he said and what are y'all gonna do? Keep having his name in your mouths? Pathetic. Move on."
