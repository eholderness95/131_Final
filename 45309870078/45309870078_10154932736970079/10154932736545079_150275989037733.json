        "message": "Went mainstream with the trump diss sorry your my hero, but thought you would never lower your self to that level I only support trump because I have faith that as an American we can overcome anything but a diss for someone you should hope makes things better is just pesimistic not to mention mainstream. You have never been mainstream rap, don't turn your back. \"Rap God\" Your supporters never turned their backs on you just because you were unconventional don't turn your back on a president who is somewhat unconventional. Grow your balls back and show them to the world."
