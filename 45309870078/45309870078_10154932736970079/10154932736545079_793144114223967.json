        "message": "I use to think Eminem was the greatest! Until his little bullshit Trump stunt. Jump on the bandwagon much Eminem? Come on man. If you at least had an album out in the last 5 years i would of thought your trump stuff to be a little more relevant. I deleted your albums from my iTunes. But i will wait and maybe one day shady will make a come back baby. But for now you got to go. No ones ever a perfect president but everyone can see what your motivation was in the video for B.E.T. It was not a freestyle \"battle\" like event that it appears either. Well rehearsed and long filming. The headlights to one of the cars in the middle was randomly off in one scene while on for the remainder. Did the battery die and someone charge it back up?! LOL!"
