        "message": "Listen Eminem, Everyone outta there know that you are the biggest motherfucking Genius of all time. After 4 fuckin years we are goin to listen some true music. After listening \"Walk On Water\", i was like WTF. Cause, I didn't find any beats. I didn't find Slimshady. I found a full grown up man who was just delivering his heartful poetry to his kids and It was just beyond the perfection. They say, sky is the limit but Slim, you have no limit in this game. Everytime you come, you come like you never came before and make every fan excitedly cum. So we talkin bout new album right? \nI guess, it is Revival ;) but slim, it maybe just a album to millions outta there but it is a \"Medicine\" to millions of Stans outta there. I was hungry. Time to grab snickers and this time you are giving me \"Snickers\" \ud83d\udc93 I love you man\ud83d\udc93 and always keep one thing in your mind that when YOU die, so does HIPHOP.\n#LoveFromNepal ^^ \n- Stan \ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffb"
