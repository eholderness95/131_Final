        "message": "Eminem-- I write to you in distress. My rhetorical question is, how do you love a man that has broken your face? The ER took only orbital x rays to determine that I have a free floating piece of fucking cheekbone under my right eye. My jaw is damaged too. Meth and alcohol fueled binga, ya know? Yeah fucking right. How do I get passed this bastatd? Your music and lyrics uplift me and bring me so much confidence but in this specific area I am still left searchingm. How do you love somebody that has literally broken you? I am no mother fucking fool except a sucker in a sick and twisted love. He took me down to the ground stomped each cheek while no was down what kind of fucking clown am I? Can you guide me poetically?"
