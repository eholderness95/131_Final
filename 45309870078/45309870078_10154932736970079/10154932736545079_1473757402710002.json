        "message": "Dear Marshall. Please stop the spoken word poetry style flow and realize that you're one of the best artists ever. Please find your confidence again and stop selling tickets to your pity party. No one is buying. You knew fame came with a price. If you're gonna retire just do it and stop whining. When you start to force something that once came naturally, it's time. Your legacy is solidified. Sincerely yours. Your fans.lol"
