        "message": "A far cry from the kid I  met in his basement after answering a post in a music store so many years ago. Went to his house with my guitar and amp \"his mom let me in the side door\" . He was sitting on a folding chair rocking back and forth and writing  even as i was setting up, then he asked my to play something to his rap. After a while I had to say, I  don't  know what you're trying to do, he said me either. He carried my heavy as hell fender smp back out to the car for me, we shook hands and I  wished him the best of luck. Very nice guy...... (y)"
