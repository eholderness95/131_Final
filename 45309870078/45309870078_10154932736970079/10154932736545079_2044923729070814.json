Who have different point political views but still love his music and supports him. And he bashes them. Lost some respect for that. I am all for him going after the man and the elites and clebs doesn't matter what political view. But to his own fans though. Idk. And I'm not a Trump supporter, but I think he shouldn't have at his fans who support him. Further dividing everyone when the goal is to come together. And music and arts is the best way."
