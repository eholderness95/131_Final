        "message": "Wasn't there but listening to your songs today and as an ER nurse your songs always cut too close to home. When I worked in Burn ICU during dressing changes, we have access to the pain pain meds for our patients so during these times we kept the fine line to do our best to keep them out of pain, but we play music, loud and very often you were the appropriate background. Thanks for getting patients and us through hard times. Just sayin'."
