I can also assure you that America is a better place without the murder and obfuscation that is rampant in the Kennedy political family. The fact that Boston, itself, is still alive has more to do with tourism than old money any more. If Boston is so great...how come they can't even solve their mass transit problems? They've had plenty of time, and millions of dollars, thrown at them. Austin is in a red state, tard. As for the city itself; ask yourself what the draw would be without SXSW and ACL. Speaking of a blue city in a red state...what's up with their pathetic health services? LA and SF are in California. Anyone who uses California as a reference for what's good about America is dumber than I thought. I saw those in your list, and almost couldn't stop laughing long enough to type this...but I persevered. Portland Oregon has an above average problem with homelessness...WAY above average. How do you explain that? Seattle Washington is another city, like Boston, that benefited, for a while, from the philanthropy of the software gurus who, unbelievably, made Seattle their home. Take that away, and what are you left with. I am SO glad you included Chicago in your list. Illinois is a red state, that has been overpowered by the illegals, the dead people, and the out of state relatives of Chicago welfare scammers for decades. Chicago is the only democratically controlled city in Illinois...and, by themselves, they have managed to bankrupt the entire state by 'losing' money that the state grants to Chicago public schools...I'm sorry, did I say, 'losing'...I meant 'misplacing into personal bank accounts', 'misappropriating' public funds meant to use for infrastructure on their pathetic roads, and having it 'accidentally' go into the re-election coffers of Chicago democrats, and destroying the Illinois Lottery by flat out stealing the funds meant to pay off winners (they've since disbanded the Illinois Lottery, because they can't afford to pay off any wins) and using it to pay bogus welfare claims made by people who aren't even American citizens...much less Illinois residents. Chicago is so worthy of derision that it belongs in California. If it were...Illinois might be able to survive...speaking of surviving...I recommend that you go buy yourself a nice property in the heart of Chicago...we'll see how long you escape with your pathetic excuse for a life...anything else you'd like to discuss?"
