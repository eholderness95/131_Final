Do you think people would care if Trump was saying/doing any of the stuff he gets shit for now if he weren't president? Yeah, it might be in the news every now and then but at the end of the day no one would care. It would just be another thing for the tabloids. Trump isn't just anyone. He's not a rapper who has built an alter ego known for being offensive. He represents our country. Can you imagine the outrage that would have ensued if any past president said something like \"grab her by the pussy\"? People are still holding him to the standards of a celebrity. He gets away with saying what he does because of the persona that he built before presidency. He isn't held to the standard of respect and class that a president should have."
