How about do some research. I highly doubt a racist would clothe, feed and provide housing for Jennifer Hudson.... and joe it's my right as a citizen of this beautiful country to own as much ammo and as many guns as I want to protect myself and others or to form a militia against a corrupt government. Never a threat but a promise to this land and my people that if any enemy attacked my president I would stand up with millions of others and do what needs done."
