        "message": "A man with the last name \"Mathers' has helped me at several key moments. Kinda like an angel. He comes out of nowhere swerving into my vicinity. I live in my car now. I mark my territory. He's always a gentleman. And he has given me good advice. I noticed your \"Fuck Trump\" shout out joined by the audience. I guess those are the words that got my attention even though you dont wanna make no political statements or shit like that. Sooner or later, we all say \"I have had enough\". When we realize how much government interferes with our lives it suddenly becomes very important no matter what the fuck anyone says. Say what you need to say. Be fucking political. Get it out of your system. Speak your truth."
