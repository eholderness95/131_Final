No pictures with fans, no interview, no songs, no movies. \"The way I am\" style is enough now, for all of us. 12 hours in the first row @ Reading just for you and you have no time for your fans? We deserve it? Paul Rosemberg we deserve it? Sorry for my bad english, I am Italian and the only way to see you is travel around the world. I know you'll never answer me but what's happening Marshall? Explain it to us. We will understand it."
