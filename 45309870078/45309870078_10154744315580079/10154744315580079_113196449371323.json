We are tough people and we are in zero need of (nor do we want) crybabies who let an election outcome that did not go their way to consume them and get in the way of their JOB.   We have more important shit to worry about.  A millionaire rapper who lives with constant protection and ZERO worry about paying a bill next month has no idea and  we \"underprivileged people\"  do not connect with your opinion (wanted or in your case unwanted).  Advise (wanted or unwanted) just do your job.................entertain me not push your political opinion onto me.  Respect goes both ways and you have lost mine."
