        "message": "Eminem loves his haters as much\r\nas his fans. He plays the ego of\r\nbad guy and devil to get a rise out\r\nof u illuminati fools. He likes the\r\nfact that u hate him, he writes all\r\nhis songs about how he has so\r\nmany haters. He knows he does\r\nfucked up shit but he doesnt care.\r\nHe laughs at the fact that so many\r\nkids idolize him, he knows he\r\ndoes asshole stuff. He does it on\r\npurpose. The world was in need\r\nof an asshole. Eminem gives us\r\nthe gossip and controversy we all\r\nneed. He airs shit out real well, he\r\ndoesnt let the stench of shit\r\nfester. Go Eminem! Your a living\r\nlegend, the critics may hate you\r\nnow but the fans will mourn\r\nwhen u are gone. Keep doin what\r\nyour doin."
