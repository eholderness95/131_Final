        "message": "Seriously cannot wait til Eminem in a couple of days. It's ridiculous how insanely good this guy is. He's too good! No other rapper comes close to his technical skill and style so they can't even challenge him to set the bar higher, he just has to find the inspiration to do that shit himself. Like a true prodigy. His words are so powerful and rhymes are so complex that people take it literally and can't read between the lines that most of the time he is talking in riddles, metaphors and often his message is the complete opposite of what it seems like his superficially talking about. It's poetry on steroids. I would chop off my fingers for a chance to listen to him rap all his songs and witness his genius up close but I guess I'll just have to settle for sharing the experience with 50,000 other people up in the front row. F**king psyched!!!!!"
