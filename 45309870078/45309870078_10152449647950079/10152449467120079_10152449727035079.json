        "message": "Anyone who thinks this album is trash has no idea about what Eminem is doing... He's not trying to make catchy songs.. His emphasis is on lyricism and straight raping... That's what all of the current shady artists are about....not to mention I bet the majority of his references and word play go right over your heads... Go bump his first 3 major releases and stop fucking crying... He is the G.O.A.T. no question and this album is fire.."

If You Want To Listen To Dope Albums Listen To Illmatic By Nas Or Paid In Full By Rakim & Eric B  Nothing by Eminem Is On That  Levels That Eliminates Him From Being G.O.A.T In My Opinion Trust Me I Am A Eminem Fan But This Is My Opinion"
