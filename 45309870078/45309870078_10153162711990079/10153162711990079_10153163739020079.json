        "message": "Let me take some time just to say this, since I was young I've been listening to Shady. From the LPs,Amittyville to the songs abt Hailie. I never lost my commitment to Eminemz music let along he doesn't want me to pray for him, I've been one of the loyal fanatics, thru his evil deeds. I now feel like one of the mocking birds I wanna sing for the moment. He told me, Mzee be careful wat u wish for, but I still wanna see him in concert. Im in SA being in USA is a dream for some of us living in slum-shacks. One day, and I repeat...one day, I will share the stage with the whole of Ditroit's crew and EmInEm. \r#Damn."
