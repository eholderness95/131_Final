I know your entire catalog, and I've even improvised some bass lines of my own to some of your songs. I would love to show them to you. I'd totally be willing to pay my own airfare and hotel to come to Detroit to show you what I can do. I'm confident I could become a permanent fixture in your lyrical mixture."

I believe one day humans will look back on Eminem in the same way people today look at Shakespeare, Van Gogh, Michelangelo, DaVinci, Monet. He is an artist of the highest caliber."
