        "message": "This is just messed up. I've looked for this family on facebook and myspace but I never could find any of them. But then the day Proof met God at 1 AM (the beginning of the day) I finally realize that there are \"more\" messages in the MORE category above the messages that are from people I am not connected to. So I look in them and on my dad's birthday (March 15- the Ides of March) I had a message from Heather Bailey saying that her brother Shane passed away 3 days before. I worked at Waffle House with Shane to pay the bills for Shane's sister Heather (who was 14), his brother  , his dad , and his mom. We lived in Bailey Mobile Homes (Which is now Shady Grove) and then we moved to Mars apartments. When we were at the Mobile Home I had to take the bus there for work and back . Shane's son Sean was almost 2 and he hadn't seen him for a year but then his mom let him come stay with us for a month. He was the cutest little boy- he had blond hair and always called himself \"the baby\". Shane would play with him and Sean would get so excited and say \"My DAddy!\" They would make tents under blankets put over chairs and hide in there together. He would take him to the gas station across from our Mobile Home and the owner would let little Sean have whatever candy he picked out. Shane loved him so much. They would sleep together. When Sean was a little baby he would fall asleep on his daddy's chest and Shane wouldn't move. He loved his son SO much. His son was everything to him. After a month his mom came and got him and then she changed her number and was impossible to find. After that we moved to Mars apartments and Shane was so depressed. He lost his job and then his mom and I worked. She worked cleaning hotel rooms. that was the time d-12 world came out because it was the only CD I actually bought. I would use Shane's portable CD player to listen to it. Shane was so depressed. He just was encompassed with sorrow. He said he never wanted to have any more kids because he would feel like he was replacing Sean. His favorite song was Kid Rock's \"Only God knows knows why\" Shane left me and his family disappeared. He told me he couldn't keep keeping me down and that I deserved better. I tried to find them but never could. That was 12 years ago. The messed up part is that Shane never got to see Sean again and the sorrow killed him. He never got to see a picture or talk to him or know anything about hi.....................................................................................................................................\nMy message to his dad:\n\nI'm really sorry they are gone. Did Shane ever get to talk to his son? I see Heather has him and him mom on as facebook friends.\n\n...........................................................................................\n\nHis dad's message to me:\n\nno she poped up two days after he died on fb....................................................\n\nmy message to Heather:He had such a big heart and I could always talk to him about anything. I can't imagine how hard it must be for you. He raised you just as much as your parents did and he has always been there for you. Your dad said Keri just showed up on facebook right after this. Have you been able to talk to her about Sean or talk to Sean? I know that must be his profile that says \"Michael Bailey\". I just hope he knows how much his dad loved him. He looks so much like Shane..........................................................\nHeather's message to me\nYeah I know. And ya I talk to her all the time now...\n\n.\n\nI think Shane would have had a whole different outlook on life if he just knew that Sean was OK and how smart he is. He stayed really depressed and think he just gave up when he realized she wouldn't let him b apart of that boys life.................................................RIP Michael Shane Bailey- at least now you get to to guide and protect Michael Sean as his guardian angel."
