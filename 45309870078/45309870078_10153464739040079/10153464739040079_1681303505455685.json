        "message": "Hope \n\nIf you struggle with everything you've known, from not being fully grown to being left on your own or worse to never know... Lost it all or continuous falls that naw at your inner core until all that is left is the pain you hoard, just take step back allow what has had you down give you strength to bring you back .. Don't fall for all the emotional strain the world uses to rain down upon you ... Do what you need to find what you want too ... Wether your on top or gone through nonstop drops of locked out flops that concocted unstoppable knock downs that had you drop down ... See the glimmer and protect your heart soul from the cold concoctions that this rock found... If all goes wrong the hope the blue ball found is stronger all of the cons ... You'll make wrongs and right in the fight of strength and might but it's alright hope starts to shed its light...\n\nSo now Bounce back with a bond ... I'd give example but there is two you are standing on ... No matter how many feet of pain you reframe to be in ... See that one foot in front of the other is being a human being ...  \n\nA definition just another meaning, seeing knowing listening.. Or a soul shouting out screaming ... I control my fear and it will not have me kneeling ... If hurts what's the point of concealing ... Instead hope gives the power that allows a true mans strength become his revealing, if all is bad how a is smile possible in that reflective glass on that ceiling ... The mind kicked up the ass and mastered to not bask in your past or put on a fake mask for future laughs ... Instead it's real happiness that will last , in fact it's fact that what happens will bundle pathways of mapped I wanna be hap..py always ... Through all the bad days are mad ways of great solutions that get rid of never \nand lead to a river of always... Y\u01d2ngyu\u01cen x\u00ecngf\u00fa is the worlds Amore and if I say please do that today ... Maybe the fool you know will fall away, letting the strain of pain concave and save you in more ways ... \n\nSo now Bounce back with a bond ... I'd give example but there is two you are standing on ... No matter how many feet of pain you reframe to be in ... See that one foot in front of the other is being a human being ...  \n\nIve got a last verse and it isn't about what's worse, it's for you and all your hurt ... How to fix the rips of good that convert to evils stands that stood but you only stand because you thought you could .. You only smile because of a thought you had in the mind a while,it never should leave you exiled in a bad way with a frown of vial ... Initial trials seem infinitely impossible to be mine or your revival but disagree with everything that will cramp a style ... So I'll be ready for a grand reprisal . \n\nLeaving only the one thing for you demonstrate in the land of denial ... \n\nSo now Bounce back with a bond ... I'd give example but there is two you are standing on ... No matter how many feet of pain you reframe to be in ... See that one foot in front of the other is being a human being ..."
