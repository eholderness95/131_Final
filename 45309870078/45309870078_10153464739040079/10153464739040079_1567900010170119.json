And if addiction teaches us nothing else, it will teach us humility. We hear it said that it took our very best thinking to get to NA. Now that we're here, we're here to learn. \n\nThe NA Fellowship is a wonderful learning environment for the recovering addict. We aren't made to feel stupid at meetings. Instead, we find others who've been exactly where we've been and who've found a way out. All we have to do is admit that we don't have all the answers, then listen as others share what's worked for them. \n\nAs recovering addicts and as human beings, we have much to learn. Other addicts-and other humans-have much to teach us about what works and what doesn't. As long as we remain teachable, we can take advantage of the experience of others.\n\nJust for Today: I will admit that I don't have all the answers. I will look and listen to the experience of others for the answers I need."
