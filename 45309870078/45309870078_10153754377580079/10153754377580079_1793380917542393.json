        "message": "A few people suggest that Em should donate his money to this cause. Some say he is worth $190m. That doesn't mean he has $190m in the bank, that means he has assets (his name is an asset in his case) worth that much. What he makes in a year is a lot less. But let's go with his net worth anyway.\n\nSay he puts up just $190k of his own money, a .001% donation. That means a person making $10k a year could put up $10 and make the same dent to their paycheck.\n\nSince, as I said, Mr. Mathers makes a lot less than that, yet seems to donate more than .001%, I hope the people doing the complaining are donating a lot more than .001% of their yearly income to charity.\n\nOtherwise, you aren't coming close to what this man does for real people in need."
