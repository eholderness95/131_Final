Food, Clean water, clothes and plush toys, snuggle buddies, for the children to help bring comfort while they resettle.\nMay just be a toy, but in the hardest of times a toy can be the best company for young minds. I have my Krazy Bear. it means the world to me. \nThere are plenty of groups that do these things but with the harsh times falling on this Earth, we need more and must do more.\nAnd there is also Project R.A.G.D.O.L.L. (Robotic Autonmous Genome from the Department Of Life Living) to help spread mental health awareness."
