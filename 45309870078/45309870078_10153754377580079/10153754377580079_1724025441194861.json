        "message": ":) He's already donated 1M water bottles to the Flint water crisis and continuing to support the kids there every day, every way he/Shady Records can. He's also got budgets for giving to a lot of charities and development institutions, not like he has money laying around everywhere to just give away but he's doing his part and more, so asking for 10$, 25$ from you isn't that much in order to establish a sense of community and I mean think about it, anyone would be more motivated to hear that 50-100K people put in something to help them out instead of some rich rapper donating some money.\n\nSo the ones screaming \"Mr. Mathers should do it himself.\" :') Y'all the people he should come out of laptops with Biggie and beat up \ud83d\ude02"
