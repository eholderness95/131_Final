        "message": "If Eminem did it all himself for all he does, he'd go broke. This dude does more behind the scenes than anyone here complaining does for their owe family. $10 dollars? That's nothing. And you know how I know people complaining here are stupid? Because their talking about it's a tax write off for EM yet don't realize that anyone who donates can put it on their taxes as well. This is a win win situation and they would know this if someone donated for their education. Dumbass people!"
