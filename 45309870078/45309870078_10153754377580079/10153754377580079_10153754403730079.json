He has a HUGE fan base and this message is being seen by SO many....the more that see it, the more help Flit may receive. Just because he is a celebrity doesn't mean he has to hand his money out. He worked damn hard for his and has bills and expenses too. It's like people forget that celebrities are human too and do have a life once they get off the stage..."

Don't say someone can \"write the money off their taxes\" like that's an instant refund."

Do you actually know how many murdering and other violent \"good christians\"  there are in the world how about you read up on the white people and christian people who has committed acts of terror or genocide? There are many many examples. You're a narrow-minded bigot. Furthermore Eminem has 100's of employees and also several different charity organisations and he has since he became famous payed so much tax that it is beyond what you can probably comprehend so I would be quiet if I were you. You seem to have a need of going back to school and also to think before you watch and believe all shit that comes out of Trump's mouth."
