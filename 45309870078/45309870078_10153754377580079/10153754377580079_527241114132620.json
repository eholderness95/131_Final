        "message": "Hey man saw your Statesville story. I actually live in the town of Mooresville right beside it. I drive through Statesville almost everyday to get to work in Winston-Salem. Its got the biggest man made lake in North Carolina(Lake Norman) that stretches all the way to Charlotte. Great place to raise a family. Also MJ has a place somewhere out here. He does own the Hornets. Either way. Have a good day man. I'm glad to hear you found help out here or vise versa. By the way. What your doing on here is awesome. - Carson NC native."
