I have family in flint and didn't know GOD cared about the impoverished ravaged masses. I can't help but see the classes my country has divided us into. I'm through with this sibling rivalry. The goat god got me through the worst blockades and hellfire in my life with his passion and poetry. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udca4\nI've been writing incessantly late at night until the next night and into the day. I pray no more, lord."
