        "message": "You Millennials are all the same dumbasses.  You all expect the wealthy to pay for everything. Eminem earned his money. He came from the streets of Detroit and made his life what it is, good and bad. He owes nobody nothing but he does his part as a human being and someone that has a voice and the ability to help others.  He posted this to get help for those kids that need it and to show the younger generation that people care.  But many of you just expect a wealthy man to pay for everything.  Fuck all you Millennials. I'm sure you dumb fucks will vote for Hillary to."

You destroyed jobs and killed the environment, and now that it's next to impossible to get a decent paying job off the street with zero education or experience (something incredibly common in your generation) you turn around and blame them for being lazy and selfish. Your generation is the cause (literally) of what the Millenials became and you have the audacity to complain about it. Ridiculous."
