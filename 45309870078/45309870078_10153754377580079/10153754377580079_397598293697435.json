        "message": "As a girl who went to flint community schools, and will be attending Mott next semester, this means more than anyone could imagine. How about instead of being assholes, we thank a man for making an effort, which is obviously more than any of you are doing. Its an honor to have him as a supporter, and to know he's just as big a fan of our education as we are his music is absolutely heart warming! Only thing that'd make what he's doing better, is if he came here himself to pass them out and speak to us, maybe even share a few raps with us. I know I'd cry if he showed up at my door, and that would mean way more to me than a single penny out of his pocket. Fuck all of you trying to take a good thing and turn it into something bad. I will steady bless his soul, like he is blessing our community."
