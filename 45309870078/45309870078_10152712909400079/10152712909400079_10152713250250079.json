        "message": "So, he takes a beating before winning fights (like Rocky) he is a southpaw (like Rocky) his wife gets killed (like Mick in Rocky 3) a guy tells his wife she hasn't been with a real man (like Mr. T \"Clubber Lane\" in Rocky 3) he goes back to some hole in the wall type of gym for a job (beginning of Rocky 2) and he seeks the training of the black coach to help him make a triumphant return (again, Rocky 3)...I feel like this movie is going to remind me a lot of a certain series of movies that have already come out, right Joe Sedivy?"
