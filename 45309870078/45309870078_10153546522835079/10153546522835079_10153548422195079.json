        "message": "When you follow your dreams stay persistent and give it all you got, then even against all odds you can reach them. Eminem a poor white kid from the ghetto against all odds entered a predominantly black profession, and became one of the best rap artists in history. And the best lyricist to ever do it his lyrics and word play are unmatched. Then he battled addiction and overcame it. One of the hardest things to do. Something 90% of addicts can't do. He inspires me and shows me there is no reason no excuse any one can't become successful at what they do and persever in life. He went from this run down little home in the ghetto driving a junker to all he has now. As a recovering addict my self clean 4 years I went from living in Camden city NJ like Detroit homeless at times to sucsessfull at what I do one of the best a beautiful family beautiful home in a uperclass neighborhood and a will to keep pushing forward."
