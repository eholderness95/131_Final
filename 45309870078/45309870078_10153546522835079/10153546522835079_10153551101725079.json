Why didn't you just send him one of those trolling emails that says if Slim gives you $100k you can get your money out of a foreign bank account and then he'll get $1m back. Bullshit dude. Straight up not right. I've got a better chance of getting something from Slim than this guy does.... I'm a widow with 2 girls still at home, I can't work cuz I hurt my back, I live in Michigan, and I don't have anyone who can help us. BUT... I WOULD NEVER ASK FOR A HANDOUT IT'S NOT RIGHT! Not cool.

But you pull yourself up off the ground, dust yourself off, and keep going. I have a very good friend who immigrated from Russia. When she got here, they had nothing. She worked hard, went to college, and now she owns her very first home. If you want a better life, do something about it. When you succeed, you will be more proud of yourself than you would by getting a handout. I will continue to pray for peace in Russia and Syria."

I guarantee that you won't be getting any help from Eminem. I'm sorry for your situation, I really am, but you are going to have to panhandle, beg, plead, steal or stop spending money on extra things so you can make your lives better. There are Apostolic Pentecostal Christian Churches in every major city in Russia that are supported by American Churches where you can get help for yourself and your family. Have you considered that maybe, just maybe, God is trying to show you how real HE is? Get to a church. God will help you because you will not find any help here. God bless!"
