        "message": "According to Vine Report, some rumours are suggesting that Eminem already recorded 8 new tracks of his next studio album, one of them with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 50 Cent. Apparently the Rap God is spending most of his time working on his new, most-awaited album.\n\nAccording to a previous report by Media Mass, however, the new album is still in early stages, which suggest that it is not going to be released anytime soon. Since there isn't any official confirmation, we can only speculate that the new album is likely going to be released at the end of 2016, or in the first months of 2017"
