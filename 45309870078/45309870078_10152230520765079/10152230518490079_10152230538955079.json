        "message": "Yo Marshall Mathers, you practically raised me wen my father was too immature, just like hailie I grew up knowing right from wrong that was justa given tho.. Anyway I pray one day you come back to L.A., & perform at the Staples center or somewhere really nearby, I had no luck whatsoever but theres something in my gut that tells me I Have to see you live & Have a pic at least, Before you or I pass on, you are in the right position for this life & I respect & admire that, I wouldn't call my self a fan or obsessed with you or your lyricism, More of a admirer. Nothin but love have much more fun Eminem!!!"
