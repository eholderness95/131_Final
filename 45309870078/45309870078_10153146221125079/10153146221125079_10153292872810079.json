I'm glad you have your daughter to bring you happiness, while dealing with the loss of your best friend. Even though it was over a decade ago, I know it remains close to you. I lost my dear friend, Colin in 03. Think about him whenever I hear Em's music. Time to warp indeed. Have a great life. Make it count!"
