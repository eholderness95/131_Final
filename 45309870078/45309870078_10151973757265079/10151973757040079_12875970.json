        "message": "How about going to another city instead of adding to the same three. It's getting a little frustrating having Detroit/NY shows with Jay Z then a tour of Europe with Kendrick Lamar and shows in Australia and wherever then shows in Detroit, New York and LA? Throwing out my gut feeling I would say there is at least 75% of the country that couldn't make these shows even if there were 7 in each city."
