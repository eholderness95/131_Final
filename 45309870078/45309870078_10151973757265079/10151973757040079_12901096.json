        "message": "Wanted to get tickets for my 18 year old son for his birthday - would be his first concert ever. It is ridiculous that people are allowed to buy tickets and immediately post them on Stub Hub for twice the value. What is the difference between that and scalping tickets?  The system needs to be overhauled to keep greedy idiots from making a buck while true fans can't get tickets."
