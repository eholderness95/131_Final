Like snoop said 2pac is the greatest to do it and he said it puts 2pac on the level of a god what he was able to predict in his songs. Eminem isn't on that level."

He has made over 200 songs in the last year of his life and not one of them is a bad song look at the kim song by eminem he has made such mistakes in music alot of times the newer albums cant compete with any of the songs pac has made its not fair to compare eminem to pac because if pac wouldent have died the rap game would not have been what it is now so if we compare eminem and pac we cant realy take the mmlp2 album into the talk because thats a totaly different piece of pie and if you compare both of them than you could say they were on equal levels but thats not the case the average quality of a song of pac is higher and em just dous not come close and never will but its not fair to compare them they are 2 very different rappers"
