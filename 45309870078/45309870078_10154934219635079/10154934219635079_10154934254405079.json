        "message": "You dont need to like Em or his music but I feel people are getting to critical and missing the point of the song watch the interview and just read into what this song is and not how it sounds. People are quick to speak and judge instead of taking lyrics for what they are and its kinda sad considering what people are calling rap right now"
