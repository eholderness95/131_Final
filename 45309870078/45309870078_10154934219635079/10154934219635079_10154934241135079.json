Eminem says something you don't agree with and your little feelings get hurt. It was a free style, not even a song, and you got offended by it. How about you grow a pair and focus your anger on something a little more important instead of writing a comment in all caps to express said anger, in the hopes that Eminem will either notice you or care. News flash. He doesn't. So go ahead, stop being a fan, not a problem with me. Just don't parade around commenting on his posts about hurt your feelings are. You think your opinion is way more important than it actually is."

I never said you were the only one, I said what you're saying has no impact on what he does. That's great thay you're trying to change people's hateful mentalities, but typing an angry comment on Facebook in all caps is not the way to do it. Did you listen to his new song? He does know he's getting old, and yes I'm sure he is aware that he isn't as popular as he used to be, but that 'fuck it' mentality has always been there from the start of his career. It didn't just start now."
