Little you are grateful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd He is the One who created you on the earth, and it is He unto whom you will be gathered together.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd He is the One who gives life and brings death, and it is He who controls the alternation of night and day. So, do you not understand?\u201d\n\n(Quran 23:74 - 80)"
