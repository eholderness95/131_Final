            "message": "What are you doing to change Africa's water drought situation? I doubt you even so much as sponsor a child in Africa, I donate to one in Kenya and one in Zimbabwe. A boy named Evariste who has two siblings and a girl named Christine. One through \"because I am a girl\" campaign and one through \"world Vision\". If i so choose to waste some water that I paid for to go towards another good cause, I will. If I had more I would give more, I have four beautiful children of my own and we struggle, live below the poverty line and we still make due, this picture is disheartening but it isn't going to bring about any type of change. You wish to see change? Do something that changes it instead!"
