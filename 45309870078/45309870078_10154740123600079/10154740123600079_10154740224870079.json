        "message": "I want to be honest! I have never had the chance to see Eminem live yet..but I promise next time you come to W.P.B., Florida I will be there. Eminem's story from the beginning really hit home with me. I love hard core metal and right now am promoting a Metal band named Pecado. But, this girl loves good rap music and Eminem is the best I have ever heard. I may be a metal head but don't get me wrong I can dance and get down with the hip hop and the rap! My baby's father used to spin records back in the 80's in the clubs. Anyone remember the daisy duke days early 90's late 80's I think. They always said I was the white girl who danced like the black girls! That bootie! lol just playing But yes....I will be at the next show that comes to my amphitheater 4 sho! Shakita is not my tag anymore I just go by Sharon.......Happy Saturday to all and to all arrive alive and don't drink and drive. Peace out Peeps"
