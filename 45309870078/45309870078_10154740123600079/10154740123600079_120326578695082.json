        "message": "Eminem on the 27th of August you made an apperance to the #leedsfestival2k17. I had 3 tickets ready to come see my faviourte artist perform unfortunatly on the morning my 80 yr old nan had collapsed on her stairs and had been there for 3 days. She is now hospitalised and is still in hospital today in a critical condition. My mum and i are trying to get a refund for the tickets and Ticketmaster will not refund us so around \u00a3210 has been gone. These comments are just an apology for not seeing you at your even as i saw you 4 years ago at the leeds fest before as the age of 10 and im now 14 years of age and has been a massive die hard fan of yours for 6 years now yet again i apologise for missing you at this event seen as though you being there was the only reason i was going to attend just a like on these comments would mean so much and ill try come to a concert again soon."
