The disease, the mosquito virus, respiratory, mold & others that are on the way. Please pray for them, pray for our President and leaders to make good decisions and lead with compassion.  Pray for the first responders and the massive volunteers. Pray we all band together and do the right thing for the victims of Hurricane Harvey. \nGod Bless! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf1\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf1\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf1\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb"
