        "message": "Once industrialization left for china ,mexico, thailand - detroit wasnt able to support volume of people who stayed. Speaking of bitching  - youre attacking a poor place and not really even know why its poor - otherwise uoud pity detroit. Trumps a lost cause ; hes the epitome of the triad of evil ;  hes a narcissist machiavellan sociopath - hes bringing divisiveness to cover up what billionaires are doing to our economy - youre worried about pathetic things - try worrying about america being screwed  by corporations writing their own tules through high government positions - oil is keeping us from clean energy - the rich dont suport infrastructure - care about what really matters"
