I'm Brian Dawkins\nVersus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense\nSo bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins\nIt's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins\n'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers\nYou gon' die a ball licker I've been diabolical\nWith this dialogue since 99 Rawkus\nYou don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can\nSuck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass\nIn a flying saucer full of Italian sausage\nThe most high exalting and I ain't halting\nTill I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes\nThe best part about me is I am not you\nI'm me and I'm the Fire Marshall and this is my\n\nLegacy, legacy, eh\nThis is my legacy, legacy, eh\nThere's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see\nThis is my legacy, legacy\nLegacy, legacy"
