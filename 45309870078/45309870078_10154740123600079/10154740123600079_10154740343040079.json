I bet you're probably sick of me now\nAin't you, Momma? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!\n\n[Hook]\nI'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet\n(One more time!)\nI said I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got some skeletons in my closet\nAnd I don't know if no one knows it\nSo before they throw me inside my coffin and close it\nI'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73\nBefore I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD\nI was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months\nMy faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch\n\u2018Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye\nNo, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die\nI look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side\nEven if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try\nTo make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake\nI maybe made some mistakes\nBut I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today\nWhat I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb\nBut the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun\n\u2018Cause I'da killed him, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both\nIt's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show\n\n#iloveEminem"
