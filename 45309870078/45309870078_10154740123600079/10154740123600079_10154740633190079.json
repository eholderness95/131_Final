        "message": "I remember buying the slim shady lp as a kid and have my entire mind blown. Saw the english language as a tool after that. I strived to improve my grasp of it after that. Growing up with mexican immigrant parents it's hard to find a voice when you rather be alone, however i related to your music and never Doubted your craft. Stay humble as always and rep that hip hop"
