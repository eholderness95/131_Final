That\u2019s what music is about, DUH!\n\nIn this case a large portion of American & the world can relate in a BIG WAY!!! He\u2019s expressing how many of us feel, but cannot express for various reasons. I like Eminem but haven\u2019t bought any of his music yet, but I feel EXACTLY, 100%, the way he does about trump!!! (& I don\u2019t like the word \u201chate\u201d, I reserve it for the KKK but trump has their mentality). I respect & appreciate Eminem for speaking out & denouncing his fans (his choice, it\u2019s hard for me to believe some of my friends support him for so many reasons!!!) who support that psychopathic idiot!!! trump is out of touch with everything except trump & anyone who\u2019s really paying attention should be able to see that unless they\u2019re just as narcissistic & heartless as he is!!!\nTHANK YOU EMINEM!! & GOD BLESS AMERICA/The World! We all need it, especially as long as that idiot is president!!!"

The fact that you have a hard time believing some friends support trump is the EXACT reason why trump supporters are scared to even mention their political views."

And my friends that voted for trump aren\u2019t afraid to mention it around me, we just don\u2019t talk about politics. But I know some of them are no longer trump supporters because they can no longer deny the damage that he\u2019s doing. In fact I have a friend that voted for him & said she only voted for him because she figured he would get assassinated or impeached & Pence would take over. She never figured trump would last as president because he\u2019s a joke."
