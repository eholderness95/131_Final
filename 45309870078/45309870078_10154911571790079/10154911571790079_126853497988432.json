        "message": "Looking forward to the new merch. I'm also really looking forward to the new album, I don't care if it's  \"different\" or \"the same\" as your older tracks. An artist has the right to change and adapt their style as they themselves change. Consider Marshal himself when you're complaining about his appearance, style, and recent music. Listen closely to his lyrics and you may just gain some insight into his own experiences and feelings. You need to appreciate the whole package, Slim, Em, and Marshal. Peace out friends."
