        "message": "OK let's get this straight Once in for all .There are 2 types of trump voters .You got the voters who voted for him Only because they didn't want Hillary to be president Because they felt she would be worse ,Then you have the ones who voted for him because they actually support him and everything he does and who he is .Eminem Said f*** the people who actually supports him.Who gives a s*** about the good that trump is doing when the bad is much worse He is a racist f*** , Everybody knows it snoop dog knows it red man knows it all other artist knows it Football and basketball players that's why they thanked him and love him for what he did (and by supporting Eminem all the way for that they're actually saying f*** y** to ) so if you support somebody like that then its f*** y** to . Em don't want you Trumpers to follow him anyways so he's good"
