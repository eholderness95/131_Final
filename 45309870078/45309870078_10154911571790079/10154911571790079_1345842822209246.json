        "message": "I still remember this (Stan) like it was yesterday. It was an amazing piece of art. Such a great message. The sadness is that people didn't take it seriously. I see these days that people by discs just by the face of the person and probably don't even know to say if the album really is good or not...I like many singers and bands. But I'm not obsessed. It can't be like that. If not a good album comes out, I won't buy it. Of course, I don't dislike the person on the cover, but we must have our tastes..."
