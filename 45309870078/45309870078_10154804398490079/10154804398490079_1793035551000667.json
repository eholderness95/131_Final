I sleep on the cold ground in two sleeping bags with all my winter clothes on. I have physical ailments which make it so I shouldn't be working a job at all, but good luck getting SSI in this country now days. And I do not spoil my Animals, I do what I have to to keep them healthy. Try doing some research on your famous \"kibble\" crap food, maybe you will decide to \"spoil\" your pets after you see the truth!"
