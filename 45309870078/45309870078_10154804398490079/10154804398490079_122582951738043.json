        "message": "Hi!  I recently did a sponsored walk for the Samartians and I raised 324 pounds!  I am giving this to the local branch next Thursday and a reporter is going to write a article, about how I used their service years ago. When my mother died and my family disowned me, they would ring me back on my mobile, saved me from those dark nights!  I have turned my life around, now living a good standard of living, working as a writer for amazon kindle and have a good relationship. love your music!"
