        "message": "Hello Marshall, strong thoughts for you on this day. A friend who is like my sister wrote this, sincerity is so rare that she has the merit of not being ignored.\nThank you for reading his words please, they are for the one who was your brother and also for you. Take care of yourself, you miss us all.\n\n\"Happy 44th Birthday Big Proof. A friend that would give his all. A person that saw more potential then I could see. A person that will always be my friend and cared about the person no matter what, who, and why I mattered. \nProof saved my life and I will be forever thankful for. Thank you Marshall for sharing him with all of the world. And Marshall thank you because he saved my life more than you ever know. Just like you saved my life and have no idea about the girl hidden in the shadow at the rap battles. From the Shelter to W. 7mile to Osborne. Hidden in the shadow Big Proof saved my life and Marshall you did too. You will never know.\n\nR.I.P Proof \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\" Written by Ivy Brown"
