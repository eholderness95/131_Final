He has no contract that says he had to give back. He does this cuz he knows better than most what it's like to have nothin'.\n\nAnd the only joke I see is you sayin' that you love & respect this guy but don't know of the good that he does.\n\nIf you wanna take shots at millionaires not doin' enough, there's literally almost an endless supply to choose from, but not Em.\n\nAs for me, you got way more of my time and attention than I wanted to give.
