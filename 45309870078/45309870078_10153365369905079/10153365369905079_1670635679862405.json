        "message": "This man us my hero, his writing is amazing, his rap is great best rapper ever, but his words his lyrics, the man is a savant of words, almost every metaphors is one that makes u think the rap style is just his way to portray his words, display his artwork. I honestly dont think anyone will be able to accomplish his level of wordsmith until hes been dead for 400 years and even then I think his legend will remain in place, Shakespeare spanned centuries I can see Eminem doing it, he is one of few glad to be alive In the same time line as him. Peace man and play infinate at the show"
