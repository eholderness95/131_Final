        "message": "I just wanted to say that you are the biggest inspiration that I ever had to be a hip hop artist,  but I'm also paying attention. Marshall,  I know you've had a fucked up past and shit but when you wrote My Darling, I just had to be the one to tell you,  don't let the other win.  You can control yourself just as much if not more than he can,  I have a feeling that you really didn't know back then but now it's way too obvious,  the rap game is sick and twisted and those who are sicker and more twisted in the head are able to call the shots. Keep fighting Marshall,  it's never too late to take back your life"
