        "message": "I know that you won't look to my letter for you on instagram. But Marshall you've changed my life. Do you know how it works? I was depressive for years, and your songs hold me, help me to keep my feet in the ground. I really don't have money to go. But you're in my city, you know it? My heart stops just of heard it. I cab't buy the tickets for the show of the guy who made me who i am. Music is powerfull, i know it, you know it. What you've done to me i'll be forever glad. So if you can't help me, if you can't do nothing, i just want to meet you, tell you my story. And you tell me yours, it's been five years waiting for this moment. But i'll be pacient. All bless, if you want to know me, to meet me, or just help me to see you live man please call me inbox, comment here Eminem. I really love the person you are, you are my hero. God bless you!"
