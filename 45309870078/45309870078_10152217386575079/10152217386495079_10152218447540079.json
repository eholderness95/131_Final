        "message": "Hey Eminem and fans, my name is Matt and I had a bit of a favor to ask. First the fans to please like this so whoever runs this FB sees it. To Marshal, I have a sister going to your concert on Aug 7th named Lauren. She's been a fan since we were kids and shouldn't have been listening to your music, but fuck it now. Anyways, Lauren has had a really hard past couple of years dealing with a lot of things. She saved up a lot of money to come see your concert because she absolutely loves you and I think your music really encourages her. I was wondering if you could give her a quick shout out at some point in the concert. Nothing big, just a little 2 seconds of something. It would really make her year. And I would be immensely grateful. Anyways hit me back, truly yours, this is your second biggest fan, this is Matt."
