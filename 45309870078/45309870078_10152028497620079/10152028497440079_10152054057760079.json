My name is Morgan sprouse and I had an amazing brother Jordan Sprouse, I just want you to know you were my brothers absolute inspiration. He new every lyric to every song you ever wrote. He was killed last Friday night by a drunk driver in Wheat Ridge, CO. He was on his way to his friends to record music while this happened. He would've been turning 19 on the 26th of May and graduating on the 24th. My brother means the world to me and my family. But your music meant the world to him! I dont want to ask much but if there's anyway you could even just send him a prayer.recognizing him or if you'd like to see some of his music iknow you would recognize his pure talent. I hope this gets to you!- the Sprouse family"
