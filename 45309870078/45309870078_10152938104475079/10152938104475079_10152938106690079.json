            "message": "I hope you guys know that the whole 180/200/240sx designation is due to the motor, it had nothing to do with the shape of the car. A 180sx is the one that came with the ca18det usually called a \"cadet,\" the 200sx had the sr20det, and if you own a 240, the most common swap is an sr swap. The 240sx came with a ka24e from 1989-1991 and than the ka24de from there on out. The s in s13 just refers to the chassis, it is an s chassis, wether an s12, s13, s14, or s15, similar as the r chassis on the GT-R's and the Z chassis on the z's and zx's. There's other determined names to it, but that's based on the bumpers and so on, but those are always changed, so as one of the guys said, it's just an s13 coupe, don't try to denote which one it is, just simply s13. As for the Rocket Bunny kit, yes, indeed it is one. Did notice the LHD and RHD dash on it, it's odd, but like one of you guys said, movie prop. -owner 2 s13's a '90 and '92 both hatch, one pig nose and another a Silvia"
