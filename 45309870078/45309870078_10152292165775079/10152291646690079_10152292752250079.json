        "message": "These seriously need to be mass produced. These sellout way too fast! I have a job and don't spend my life on Facebook! I'm sick of these non-Eminem fans buying these items and then selling them on eBay for 5x the selling price. I fortunately was able to purchase a jersey at the concert in Detroit, but I'd like to get a hat... And I'm not paying $200 on eBay for one. \n\nIt also pisses me off that people buy all the ShadyXV shirts and do the same thing!\n\nAre you aware these are selling on eBay for $175?! For a tshirt!\n\nSeriously... Please reproduce these. There are tons of real Eminem fans that wish to purchase these items. \n\nAnd all you assholes that buy these items, only to sell them on eBay for 5x the price... Suck a dick, assholes!"

I think we all know that he is not the one posting the merchandise on Facebook, but his merch department needs to be aware of how people are ripping one another off and there should be a limit to how many items can be purchased. Or simply make more than 500, and they too, will make more money; because obviously people want these items."
