Some are very close to us and some are just hi hello friendsi.e. friends whom we just smile at or speak a word or two to. But who is our real friend?\r\nA true friend is a person who guidesus, holds our handand pulls us to the right path when wego wrong, a person we can openly share our feelings with i.e. our joys, sorrows,achievements, failures etc. A person who corrects us when we go wrong, a person who is not afraid to speak frankly about what they feel about us and help us improve. That friend is also a person who encourages us andrejoices in our success and happiness.\r\nSuch sort of a truefriend is hard to find in this world"
