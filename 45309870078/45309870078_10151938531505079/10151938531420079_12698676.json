        "message": "EMINEM! I love you man. Your the greatest man walking on this planet. No one will ever be greater than you. Your my icon,idol,hero. You mean everything to me. I'm starting to rap myself. Couldn't have had a better teacher. You taught me man. I've learned so much from your music. If I had a choice of who I would wanna be. Then I'd choose to be a friend or something. Coz if I chose to be you. There won't be such greatness.  I'm really down because I wasn't at Ellis park for your concert. That fucking sucked. I love putting on your music and just drifting away,tryna imagine what it would be like to record a song with you. Or. Just hang out with you. See I'm not gay. Fuck no. Tis just your my fucking world. I am the person I am today because of your influence on my life. I just wish I can tell my kids(if I'm gonna have any) that I stood beside the greatest man once. Damn man. I'm a STAN for life. Love you Em... Thanks."
