Stupid comments like this will irritate people it doesn't mean just because we are not American we don't deserve to be honoured with him touring our countries.  That makes me respect an artist, he also thinks of his fans in other countries."

And, Em came to here to South Africa because he knows AFRICAN americans created rap and that AFRICAN americans come from africa and so he had to come grace us with his presence!
