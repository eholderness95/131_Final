        "message": "Eminem in Johannesburg was the greatest concert ever. It blew my mind that I was standing in front of the greatest rapper in the world...someone who used to get beaten up everyday of his life as a kid not only by a bully, but even once by the principal of his school. I don't think that there is a person out there in the world who cannot appreciate Eminem or at least get inspired by him.\n\nThe best part for me was when I saw him take a sip of water, it made me realise that he is also human.\n\nI don't think I can ever enjoy a concert again like I did this one. #ThankYouMarshallBruceMathers"
