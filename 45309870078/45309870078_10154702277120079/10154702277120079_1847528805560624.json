        "message": "I used to like Eminem I grew up on 80s hip hop all the way through to late 90s then it turned shit. Then by some sort of miracle I came across a rapper writer by the name of K-RINO a few years back who has throw out approximately 30 albums and just recently released 7 albums at once. Each song on each of all his albums has more content than Eminem back catalogue. If you want substance in your drums then K RINO. is the only rapper you will ever need. Anyone know the man give me some thumbs ups beeeeaaaattttccchhhhessss"
