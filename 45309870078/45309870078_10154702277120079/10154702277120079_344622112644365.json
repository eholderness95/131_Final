Third , how many of you who don't support Trump think for one second trump would be in office if Marshall Mather's had something to say so, my comment had nothing to do with any of the comments yous are pulling out of your asses. No one gives two squirts or piss about Big Sean if they did he would be the rap god here. Forth, you don't know me to open your fucking mouth about what I feel about \" Tupac Shakur\" get his name straight obviously you don't have any respect for him. his word are far from weak. I know for fact Tupac would be all over trump to the point trump would never had a chance to get pass trump announcing he was running. DA DA DA DA   Americans lost the word retarted in their vocabulary years go asshole. My comment was on a political level .
