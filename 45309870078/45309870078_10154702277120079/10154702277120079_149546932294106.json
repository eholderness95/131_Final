        "message": "You are always in my head, replacing all my thoughts.\nAll I know is that I am lost somewhere between despair and dreams. I pile boxes empty to the sky to be able to climb higher. May I hope to see your face again today. I understand your sadness and I sometimes lodge there when it's cold. I am my dreams half-closed eyes, and when I see your shadow rod around me I watch her go without saying a word, hoping that this moment lasts forever. Eminem <3"
