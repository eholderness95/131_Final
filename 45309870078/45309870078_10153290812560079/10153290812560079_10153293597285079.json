Every time I hear \"Detroit\" I think about you in \"Forgot About Dre\" talking to the news reporter \"Detroit! Detroit Baby! What!\". I'm in the UP so I know they're like, 70 miles apart or whatever, but It's great to see native Michiganders coming together to help out a town I'm sure many government officials thought people would ignore because of the socio-economic make up of the area. Anyway, hi five man."
