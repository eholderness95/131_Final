        "message": "Eminem back in the studio, while others are fading away. EM is still continuing to perfect his craft, like the good ole Dr DRE, work ethic is non stop, that's what you call being a perfectionist, thats why they are the greatist, I will love to be in the studio, all they and night. Its beautiful and wonderful art.Continue Em, we are waiting for another big album, because Nas and dem have fade away.You continue to carry the touch."
