She ran away with her twin and two is company three is a crowd. Was she the unless bad evil twin?  Before drugs what was she like. She couldn't find a way out.  You had Elton John as a mentor. Who did she have?  You could at least with all your money set up a rehabilitation centre and name it after her. And to keep it going ex drug users could train and run marathons or sky dive and have a sense of purpose once again. I hope you gave her the best money can buy at her send off"
