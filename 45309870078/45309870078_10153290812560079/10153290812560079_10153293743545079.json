We are no longer limited to our old ideas.\"\n\nBasic Text, p. 56\n\nWe may or may not have been taught right from wrong and other basics of life as children. No matter, by the time we found recovery, most of us had only the vaguest idea of how to live. Our isolation from the rest of society had caused us to ignore basic human responsibilities and develop bizarre survival skills to cope with the world we lived in. \n\nSome of us didn't know how to tell the truth; others were so frank we wounded everyone we talked to. Some of us couldn't cope with the simplest of personal problems, while others attempted solving the problems of the whole world. Some of us never got angry, even when receiving unfair treatment; others busily lodged complaints against everyone and everything. \n\nWhatever our problems, no matter how extreme, we all have a chance in Narcotics Anonymous to learn how to live anew. Perhaps we need to learn kindness and how to care about others. Perhaps we need to accept personal responsibilities. Or maybe we need to overcome fear and take some risks. We can be certain of one thing: Each day, simply by living life, we'll learn something new.\n\nJust for Today: I know more about how to live than I did yesterday, but not as much as I'll know tomorrow. Today, I'll learn something new.\nthese mother fuckers said the doing away with houseing voulcers after june said they going to see if sec 8 will azborb me but we  know that aint happening my records to fuck up what do i do?  fuck this shit its been a giant waste of time can i please have a job slim Eminem"
