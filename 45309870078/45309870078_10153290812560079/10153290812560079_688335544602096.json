A human being.\nThat is lost to the world he knows and he knows it.\n\nThe only hold.\nIs This equally \nLost soul.\nShines. A divine glow.\nEverytime i see that girl.\nI just break down from the bones.\n\nThe only home i ever known.\nNow i have to go. Find myself.\nThat me i seemed to have lost somewhere down the road.\n\nIm far from a writer of course.\nBut im not making this for some grammy award. \nIf i feel an emotion .i get my pen. And think of a cord.\n\nI only share my thoughts with you. \nAnd yes at times. Im crazy rude.\nBut girl your my medicine.\nWithout it. Im a crazy fool.\n\nI cant get enough of you\nIts like craving the best food. im never full. \n\nAnd no i dont have to always be lyrical. \n\nBut my thoughts are tangled.\nAnd it helps me think things through.  makes them clearer to Speak them to someone so beautiful."
