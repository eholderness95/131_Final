        "message": "thank you Eminem for your dedication to this!  my family and i were in flint a couple of weeks ago helping to get the word out that boiling the water doesn't help with lead.  we pulled over on a dead end street to look up the next address we needed to visit.  a brother and his girl came out of the house we were in front of and my daughter noticed he had his hand on his gun in a holster inside his jacket.  we rolled down the window, said hi, and shared the literature we had describing where to get water and filters, and he thanked us.  looking back, i guess it wasn't such a good idea to pull up to a house on a dead end street in a brand new cadillac, but we were honestly just trying to help.  it was a good day...not only because we didn't get shot, but mainly because we found a lot of people that needed help.  if anyone is in the area, get involved!  the emergency isn't over just because the news stops talking about it."
