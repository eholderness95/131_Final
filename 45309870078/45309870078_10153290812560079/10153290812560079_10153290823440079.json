        "message": "Hi Marshall, I know it sounds corny but you are my greatest motivation, in some sense an authority, even though I know that most people would support this. Your words speak to me When I'm angry, sad, embittered, frightened, powerless, but also cheerful, full of life and conscious of its value. I wanted to write you a letter but I know that and so you did not read it. I do not know if you move your white ass to read it, but there's always hope. Just want to thank you, know that every day I pray to God to bless you and your loved ones. He makes me want to howl in pain when I see your tired eyes and a sad face absent for more recent pictures. \n                Worst is the helplessness - I can not help you, though you so damn much you've done for me without even knowing my existence.\nI am aware that for you it may be empty and worthless words, but although I'll try to get the answer. One question, one answer: your answer. \n\nAre you really happy?"
