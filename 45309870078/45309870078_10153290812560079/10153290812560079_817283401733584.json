        "message": "I thank god for Eminem, if it wasn't for you.. I have no idea where I would be.. My life is too intense to text over fb but if Eminem were to read this, I can rap and write..i love rap god along with sooo many others but i am just insecure at times..  i have alot of talent and such a great story I could make a movie from it.. but I am alone in the world, held down by my life and Eminem is the only one around me who can even relate to my pain.. i feel every word and I love you.. always have, I mean as an artist of course.. I just want you to know you are my hero <3"
