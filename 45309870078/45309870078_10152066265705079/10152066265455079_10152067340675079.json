        "message": "Eminem, I am a mother of 4 boys.. my oldest son being much older than my other 3 sons. He is 25 yrs old this year. I'm not much of a rap fan, never have been and never have cared for it. But I have always liked some of your songs you've put out through the years. This particular song/video really brought the tears flowing for me.You see, my oldest son, he has always had issues with me and for good reason to some extent. I love him very much but he has nothing to do with me.. like you, he's been through drug use and still is now, I believe. I've offered to help and to let him live with us but he refuses. I could keep going on but I won't. I just wanted to let you know that I'm proud of you for realizing Mom isn't perfect and that Mom can make mistakes too but that no matter what, Mom still loves you whether you want it or not. :) Maybe, one day, my son will realize that too. Happy Mother's Day to your Mom,  Eminem."
