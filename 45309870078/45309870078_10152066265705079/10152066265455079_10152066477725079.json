        "message": "That is by far, the greatest video and the best mother day tribute you could ever give her. A heart felt and sincere, honest, and beautiful way to tell her that no matter what happened in the past, it's there, in the past. You've grown as a MAN and now have moved forward instead of sitting in your past. You've probably just or already, created closure. Now you can focus on who she is to you NOW. being adopted and having not only a birth ma, but a foster and finally a forever ma, it's so important to realized that at the time, they did the best they could. No one knows how to be a ma. But they learn as they go. Mistakes are made, but forgiveness is powerful. To let go of all the \"hate\" and anger you hold, is by far the most freeing thing. It changes you from the inside out. Just as it did when you got sober. Your a better man, and I'm sure a terrific father. May GOD continue to guide you and bless you in the next chapter of your life."
