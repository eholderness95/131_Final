He cutted off the best part of the track (the ending) and... if you're a fan there's a lot of this story that you already know, you come here for those missing pieces you need to see to understand this decision (eminem doing this song). I think the video lacks of the power that the song already has. I get you... Im not disappointed, because this song is epic, I love the album... but this video could have been better."
