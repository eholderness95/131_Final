        "message": "My middle school students happen to love your music as do I. Though I can't play much of it in my class since the lyrics aren't considered school appropriate, I did stumble across a 60 minute interview of you in which you explain how you rhyme the word orange and stretch words. I just stared introducing poetry so this got my kids' attention and we are using your songs to analyze poetry. Thanks for being you and allowing me to reach my students that hate English class :)"
