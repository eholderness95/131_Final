        "message": "I've followed you since the beginning man. All the immature things that were said, the fucked up situations you got into, the lawsuits, the animosity with other rappers and celebrities. I'm so happy to have seen you mature into what you are. Still a little bit of that Slim Don't Give A Fuck attitude, comedy and satire. The first time I heard this song I was speechless. The most grown up thing I've ever seen somebody do. I hope you and your mother start over and rebuild your relationship. I hope she feels the same way. Keep it up man. And I know you probably won't see this, or write back, but if you do, thank you for all the good laughs, vibes, and all the amazing verses and lines you've come out with over the years. And here's to many more."
