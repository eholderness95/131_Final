        "message": "I love this song. I was a mom that made some bad choices, and when addiction consumed me I ran, seeing my 2 daughters only at Xmas for 7 yrs. I've Been back for over 3 years clean and am rebuilding the relationships. This song brings tears to my eyes, I get it. People make mistakes but with effort we can repair the damage. Your mom had a big part in who you are today as a man and artist."
