        "message": "I just wanted to wish Proof a late Happy Bday. I miss him so much. I doubt that this is really Marshall but if it is - please post a pic of his headstone. \n\nProof and I were great friends. I can prove this if this is really Em. He was one of my good friends in Scottsdale Az. He was part of the Associates and he used to come visit me in Az all the time. He used to stay at the Hyatt downtown and Ritz in Biltmore area. He meant so much to me and I miss him every day. \n\nI don't know if you remember him coming and getting me for the UP in Smoke tour in Phx and taking good care of me. I have the pics with you and him to prove it. I really just wish I knew someone else that knew Proof like I did and Misses him like I do. \n\nIf for some miracle this is you - please get ahold of me. Its your bday soon and Proofs was yesterday. \n\nAnessa Perry"
