        "message": "I really miss how Proof used to write on napkins every where we went! I always laugh when I think about how he used to miss spagetti and Ramen noodles and how incredibly smart he was. Please tell Swifty and Kuniva I said hello too. I miss those boys big time. Good Peoples. Im sure you all missing playing ball with Proof and all his goofy antics. He was the best. I cried all day yesterday thinking about all the memories we had together and just wish I had someone to talk to the felt the same way or could relate. Proof changed my life in so many ways. \n\nIf this is REALLY Marshall - Please shoot me a msg or call or something and just re-hash some old Proof memories with me! I miss him so much. Its so hard to miss someone every day and have no one to talk about it with. \n\nAnessa Perry"
