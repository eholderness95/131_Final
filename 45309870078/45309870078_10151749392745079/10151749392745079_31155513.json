        "message": "Dope interview Em. When I listen to Eminem, I go through a wide range of raw emotions and that to me is what Hip Hop is supposed to be about, the ability to move a person, hence the song by Rakim \"Move The Crowd\". His versatility captivates his listeners and allows them to connect with him. No other rapper on this planet has this ability. Shady can sing a chorus, be comical, dead serious, or tongue twist rhymes that will make your head spin. He's undoubtedly THE Best in the game. <3 #RAPGOD"
