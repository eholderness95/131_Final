        "message": "this comment will most probably just get lost in the comments, but I just thought Id say Eminem you are by far my favourite singer/song writer ever.. ever since I was born my dad would play your music in the car on a custom tape recorder just full of your songs, and still to this day I remain a loyal fan. And next year on the 17th of Feb I will be travelling to Melbourne from Perth to watch you perform this is for my 17th birthday present. This is no doubt going to be one of the greatest moments in my life, but if you somehow manage to see this comment please get me on stage at your concert as that would be the greatest moment in my life.. Eminem I love you, you are a rap god !! <3"
