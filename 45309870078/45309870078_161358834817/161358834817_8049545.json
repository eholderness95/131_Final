        "message": "eminem youre new album is terrible, but you still have it in you, it seems like the less about the lyrics, the better they sound, but when you sit down, and write lyrics, you suffer through writers block, and resort to coming up with lyrics that do not make any sense, your best album was the marshall mathers lp, and from there when you started getting famous it went down hill, you have no more inspiration since you reached the top, but you can rap about the streets and the hustlin that goes on, you might not be involved in it no more, or if you ever were, but you got talent."
