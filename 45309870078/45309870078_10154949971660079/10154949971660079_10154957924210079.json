My thumbs want me to offer to buy you a burger. Because my heart says this guy needs a burger and someone to pay for his meal. But like. Im not going to post this. Because. I am completely not weird. And my Facebook happy phone never wins because i literally control it. So. Again. Ignore me. Because. I am sane. And didn't actually press post after this just because i want to. And i never do anything i want."
