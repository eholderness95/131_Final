        "message": "This is my first time... please reply to me if you want to, don't leave me hanging...\nWhen Eminem says:\n\"Shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth\n Should have never been allowed a mouth\"\n\nWhat I think and hear is:\n\"Shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth\n Should have never been.'Allow him out now'\"\n\nIt shouldn't rhyme though... He's saying that the illuminati shouldn't have allowed him out\nNow that he got a higher power now meaning he was got God on his side\nAnd now he's kicking the devil to the side cause he doesn't need him\nSince he got fame, money, and the one he loves(he's daughter)\nAnd since he's partner of shady records Paul  is leaving(He said it in the interview)\nEminem is finally going to have full control of his studio\nAnd will be able to produce the music he wanted to from the start well he did make the music,\nThe music he was asked to do by the illuminati but Eminem always added a twisted and for some reason\nThey didn't notice it or they probably did but didn't worry cause they thought he never was going to get out\nBut in best friend he says that they made a mistake and they gave him too much power\nAnd is way over them and he was planning to leave them from the start because of the way he treated him.\n\n(25 to life is a perfect example)\nHe said he was leaving them \"Fuck you hip hop, I'm leaving you, My life sentence is served bitch and it's just...\"\nSo due to telling them that they panicked and obviously threatened him to kill him\nBut he didn't give in so they begged him to stay and gave him more fame, money and fortune in other words more power.\nSo now that he has enough power after so many mind blowing songs like:\n\nFast Lane\nLiving Proof\nLoud Noise\nLighters\nBeautiful Pain\nRap God\nThe Monster\nCalm Down\nFine Line\nPsychopathic Killer\nTwisted\nGuts Over Fear\nDetroit v.s Everybody\nBest Friend\nWorld Wide Choppers 2(Speedom)NEW*\n\nAll these songs were legendary and there was lots of income,\nDon't forget a lot of 'power' as well\nWhich Eminem has gained\nAnd now will finally use it\n\nTech n9ne has invested alot of money just to pay for Eminem\nBut Eminem didn't want any money,\nAll he want was for him to be on a song with him\nI'm sure they are going to tackle the Illuminati together in this song\nBut Tech might just get Eminem to make it an Evil song\nsince he is part of the illuminati STILL\n\nBut that's all what I think\nI pray that Eminem gets out totally and alive with his soul back... somehow..."
