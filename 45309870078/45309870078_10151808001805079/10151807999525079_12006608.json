Get off Em's dick, and go listen to people like Rakim, Big L, Wu-Tang Clan, Tech N9ne, Dizzy Wright, Big Pun, and every other great name to touch down in Hip-hop and see that some rappers are better than Eminem, and MC's are even greater than your \"rap god\". As much as I like Eminem (the classic one), you fans (Stan's) make it too hard to be an Eminem fan."
