To win people over to your opinion? Waste of time...once an opinion is formed its not going to change. So, negativity in these posts are pointless. If someone is a fan of the music, they can give support... That's not wasting time, because you are being polite...something this world needs more of."

Not everyone has the same taste.  I\u2019ve bought plenty of albums over the years from all different kinds of artists and to be honest there are usually several I end up not liking but I don\u2019t stop listening to that artist because of it.  I just don\u2019t listen to the songs I don\u2019t like.  Why do people have to condemn so much any more?  Why can\u2019t people just not listen to what they don\u2019t like or not watch what they don\u2019t want to see or ignore social media posts they don\u2019t agree with and not comment or blast the hell out of people?  I just don\u2019t get the world anymore!!  Sorry rant over."
