He essentially made racist comments and once again insulted some of his fans...\n#4. He Told everyone to \"Hate Trump\" I'm no genius but telling people to hate anyone isn't really something anyone should be proud of.... \n#5 Guess WHAT it's not like he was trying to get in the news or anything because he has a new album or something coming out and get free publicity right ohh wait...
