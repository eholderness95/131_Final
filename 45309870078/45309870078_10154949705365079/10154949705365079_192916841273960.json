        "message": "Best damn thing I've heard in a long time. No matter what anyone says I'll always love Em and his music. Man went through hell in life growing up and came out a rap God in the end. All you haters need to stop and understand that he's just human like all of us. Except that he is a fighter and has gone through shit that we can only imagine. Yet he's still here rapping today. And he does it for us, yet you all are hating on him. Don't try and tell me that Drake and then other fools are better rappers? Just give the man a break. Instead of dissing the song actually listen to the lyrics. It's not always about the beat. The man is a fucken genius! Love you Em!"
