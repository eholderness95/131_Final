And secondly he has gotten a lot of things in his life by bullying people into doing what's best for him. He consistly talks shit about hard working people and good role models because they won't stand for the anthem \n\nI'm not saying your just another stupid Trump supporter because I realise not all are the same, but you have to realise the irony of your comment."
