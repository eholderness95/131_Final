        "message": "Nobody is mentioning that Beyonc\u00e8 was in this too. Both of these artists are in top ten album sales in the world. They clearly do not give a fuck who buys their shit. This song is more poetic for them, and i wouldnt doubt his album is that way also. Its justified. I\u2019m excited to see what the album has to offer when it comes out, because i think by now em has mastered the game, im sure he has some fire tracks on it."
