        "message": "I've been riding Em's dick since the age of 7 and i must tell you this from then on i listened to possibly every incredible lyricist and i found no one even coming close , i must say i was dissapointed on the song i was too angry and expected too much i guess but after i listened to it like 10 times , wow fuckin wow the song is amazing guys it's suhm different he was literally talking to us the whole song,  Em don't even need to prove himself to anyone he has broken so many records it's crazy just the other day he won a fuckin award for best hip-hop \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and even he himself was confused as fuck , this guy got power's and i don't understand where from but he's just human after all like all of us , I've gone through so much in my life and Em's music was the only thing that kept me from going insane , the album will do well win awards break a few record's as always nuhn new , we just got so used to him winning everytime that we can't even imagine him losing , Em thank you bro you are a God"
