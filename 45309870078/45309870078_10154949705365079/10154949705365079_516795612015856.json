        "message": "When I was a kid you got me through a lot of tough shit. My mother and yours could be best friends. I thank you for that. Now as an adult I can look back and realize your music got me through shit I might not have got through on my own. Also as an adult I recognize that childhood heroes can't alway stand up to adult scrutiny. Trump isn't the greatest president of all time, but he was better than all the alternatives. You drew your line, and I'll proudly stand by my decision. Peace."
