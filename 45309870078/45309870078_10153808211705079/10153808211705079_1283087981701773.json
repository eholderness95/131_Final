        "message": "When my 14 year old son was a toddler, we used to listen to a lot of Eminem. Eminem is probably his favorite star of all time. I admit, he inspired me alot too, while his music kept me company throughout the years. I have been listening since my teens. I'm 34. My son and I are an aspiring rap duo :) Thanks Em"
