I'm trying to figure out a little comfort and go strong and make Positive out of a Negative!! I am a KIMMEL and would appreciate a little acknowledgement of my daughters passing with helping of any non profit or organizations YOU MAY have going on! I want to help the preteens the teenagers that are lost due to their upbringings and let them be HEARD regardless of their personal beliefs, sexuality and religion! We TRULY are all ONE!!\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\u270c\ufe0f\ufe0f\nKIMBERLY KIMMEL"
