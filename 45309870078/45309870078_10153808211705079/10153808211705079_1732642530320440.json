        "message": "Dear Slim Shady, I realise our governement are mutha fuckers and I know they plagurized the hell out of your song, but the everyday people of NZ are massive fans. I personally have been a lover since Slim Shady first stood up....decades in fact. Now the excellent people of NZ are facing many a battle with the accused cheating governement-child poverty, homelessness, taxdodging corporates, raping of our natural resources. They deserve no less than to be taken to the cleaners! WE the tax-paying plebs of this country will be fitting the bill for their greedy use of your material, their expectation that they can get away with anything. We cannot afford these costs but I do understand that they must be accountable. NZ is a beautiful peaceful country and I would suggest this. Ask for a property, a gorgeous beach or mountain property. Make them accountable for their ruthless ignorance of their people....I look forward to seeing how it plays out and nothing gives me more joy than seeing our Prime Minister fucked over...your friend"
