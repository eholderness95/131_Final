I am her mother, Kimberly Kimmel, Erika, my 21 year old passed from peer pressure of a drug called oxymorphone. She did not do this sort of thing and preferred organic ways of taking the edge off, which as her mother I would have preferred that, to be completely honest.mshe suffered from Anxiety, ADD which can result in Depression. She had such a huge heart and so full of life it was a tradegy to most around especially to her sister, myself and her father."
