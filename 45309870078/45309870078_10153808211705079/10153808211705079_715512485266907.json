        "message": "I just wanna thank you Eminem \nFor giving me the ability to kill syllables and synonyms \nSome people say that I'm an Eminem wanna be \nBetter yet a Stan \nOr a dick riding fan \nBut these assholes really don't  understand \nWhat is like to relate to music \nThe pencil is my weapon , Thank God I know how to use it \nWithout music I would probably mothafuckin' lose it \nThis I will not refuse it \nGotta pay homage \nWhat I portray on the page equals damage \nYou got me into the whole craft \nMetaphors , Punchlines , Smilies , Pro rap \nBack then my lyrics sucked like when hoes gag \nBut ever since I've listened to you , The world cracked \nIt was cool like a snow act \nHaving the power to come up with dope lyrics \nAnd not giving a shit about ho critics \nJust like how you wrote for your daughter Hailie \nI also write for my baby Emily \nIt's crazy cuz constantly , Usually \nI think about writing her a song daily \nLove that song 97' Bonnie and Cylde on the Slim Shady EP \nJust like how your Dad left you \nMy Mom left me \nI was 10 I remember vividly \nMoments of torture \nAlways had that cold lonely feeling like soul search \nBut I kept my chin up and walked along \nHey Mom look I just socked the wall \nWhat am I saying ? , You were absence \nAwww \nYou were gone like the wind \nIt had me broken but I still had \nGod within \nI was meant for a great purpose \nI put my sweat and tears lyrically I earn this \nOnce again Eminem , Thanks"
