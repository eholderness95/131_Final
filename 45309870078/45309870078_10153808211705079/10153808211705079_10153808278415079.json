        "message": "If you see this man, i gotta say youve helped me through my whole life. Your first album made me laugh, cry and even remember the best days i had up until then. I grew up with just my dad, my mom kinda left us when i was 5 so thats all i had, and even when i heard asshole parents complain about your lyrics for being explicit,i always wanted to tell them if you were in his shoes his whole life youd be explicit too. The truth is always explicit but people sugar coat it and i appreciate every bit of honesty youve made into your work. I dont rap but i hope one day ill be as sucessful as you because i feel to strong to perservere through every hate comment i see. Honestly thank you marshall, slim, eminem. Always a fan till the end and i hope all is well and will be well."
