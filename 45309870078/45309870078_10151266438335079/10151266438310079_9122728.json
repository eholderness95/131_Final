        "message": "Hi everyone, I'm an up and coming rapper from Philadelphia who is asking for a chance. I put a lot of effort and time into my lyrics which has resulted in an above par following via YouTube. I've been told and recognized that if I have the a strong following through social medias, I may be able to make my dream a reality. I am lyrical, and already do shows regularly. So I promise if you do give my music a chance, you will NOT be disappointed. Help me, a young individual trying to make his dream a reality, by tuning into one of my songs on my page and/or liking my page as a whole. I hope to hear from you all - Tone https://www.facebook.com/ToneTheOriginal?fref=ts"
