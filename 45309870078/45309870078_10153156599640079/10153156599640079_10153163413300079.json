        "message": "On behalf of Layla Watson, 50 Cent is on your books! This is disgusting, you have most probably seen the photos. Fix it!  \n\n50 Cent is on your books? Yeah! last night my 12 year old nephew went to see 50 cent and g unit and even after having a vodka bottle thrown at him and his Aunty from some idiot in the crowd he still continued to support you! So Mr Curtis Jackson just to let you know He waited 2 & 1/2 hrs in your hotel lobby for a chance to meet you an have his piece of paper signed!! You didn't even acknowledge him you just sat in your car an looked right through him! You didn't even need to get out you could have made his day by simply giving him a wave or even just a smile of acknowledgment from your comfy/warm car what makes it worst is I believe it's your last European tour so his chances of ever getting his dream are gone! So here's to you Mr Curtis Jackson well done sir you have disappointed a young man who seen you as an inspiration and as sad as it is he still does! \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude21 please share on to show how much of an arrogant arse he is!!"
