Eminem is not to be trusted lol The only reason he won't sign me is because im a better female version of him and he'd lose that rap battle. Poverty dude is like a walk in the park compared to my story and i was even recently homeless last year in Michigan and he's not lying it was freaking ghost town scary like their richest town makes bellport/Gordon heights ect.. look like the hamptons."
