All you do in your ego and flesh will be burned up in the fire.  Quit running from it.  In the presence of God the fire leads to mourning.  It heals, you experience forgiveness and from that grows the fruit of compassion, kindness, patience, long suffering, love, and after that joy.  You can not forgive if you do not believe God forgave you.  The first death is a gentle fire. It is not hot or torturous.  He who goes through the first death will not suffer the second death which is the lake of fire.  Those who are thrown in the lake of fire will feel the torture and pain of everything.  Satan's kingdom lives off the blood of the Saints.  His kingdom will go into the lake of fire and feel the smoke of their torment.  Satan can not save you.  Loose the horns Marshall."

It is at enmity towards God.  We are all in the same boat.  Each of us according to God's time will draw us into the spirit which is full of rain and cleansing.  He will tear down walls we build to avoid the pain.  He will lead us into our hearts in which we avoid.  Hurt turns into anger then turns into apathy.  God will melt the ice by His comfort.  Blessed are those who moan for they shall be comforted.  We come to know God as Comforter.  What the Son of God did on the cross is finished.  Now it is being revealed in us.  The heart is a hard place to dwell in but that is where you will find Him.  Our heart is the soil where the fruit of the spirit grows from.  The broken hearts won't tread their.  Too painful.  But soil needs rain.  He releases are unshed tears.  He takes out the rocks and hardness.  He takes all of the bad, the shit and rotten experiences and uses it as compost because after we've healed we can then reach out to others because we experience God's compassion and Grace and mercy for our sin and wounds and he uses this compost to help others."

After this is what I wrote to express what I went through.  \"When there is nothing left to say, when confusion fades away, and the time you live today is born in freedom.  When the sky has gone from grey to a brilliant bright blue shade, and the pain that never strays leaves home this season.
