        "message": "Fuck all the bullshit.  When's the new mother fuckn 2017 album comn out.  And were gettn old em. Do u think u can actually do a U.S  tour on this album so the fans that support u threw all these years have the chance to see u live.  I don't mean a 5 show tour and all in Detroit.  Ull sell out anywhere u go.   Come down to dodge city, kansas and dress up as wyatt earp. I dont care if u set up stage in the middle of the damn corn fields in liberal, kansas...  a children of the corn show would b great.  Ull have more people than Woodstock show up.  Our part of the state and U.S. gets overlooked and we don't get shit.  Its like we don't fuckn matter."
