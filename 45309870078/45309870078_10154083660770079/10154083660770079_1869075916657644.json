        "message": "I was wondering what you thought of Bob Rivers' \"What If Eminem Did Jingle Bells?\" I'm pretty positive you would have heard it because I think Bob would have to get your permission to use your name, but with parody laws, I don't know. This song makes me think you could make a great Christmas album, utilizing your style, that's never been heard before. Something to think about... :D \nhttps://youtu.be/heeT6E7KBUE"
