        "message": "I like the song I just think the chorus is to long and brings the song down a bit, but Em's parts shows that he is one the greatest lyricist alive. Like one of the other comments said, Em can't write about the same shit he wrote about 15yrs ago. just like everyone else in the world he has grown and changed his views on life, but like the Em of the past he is still showing/telling the people what they need to hear!"
