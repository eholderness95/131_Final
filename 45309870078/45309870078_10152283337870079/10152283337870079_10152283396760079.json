        "message": "People hatin on him now because they say hes \"too soft\", and hes past his \"prime\" which is not true. Hes older now which means hes not gonna talk about rape, or cutting and murding people and throwing back in the back of his trunk. Plus, they are also saying he was better when he was on drugs.... HE STOPPED USING DRUGS CUZ IT ALMOST KILLED HIM! He still hasnt lost his unique rapping ability. I love Your music, Em. Love the song, too! Keep rockin!!"
