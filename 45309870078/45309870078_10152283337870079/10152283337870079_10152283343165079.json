But He's my idol and i gotta support him."

But it isn't even 10% of what his musics used to be. If you don't realize that compare this music with \"Beautiful\" or \"Stan\" and look at the difference."

He can't feel the same way he did back in 1998 and 1999. It's not right to have that.Mentality. If you were famous don't think things for you will change?us fans have too realize that writing music and beats is extremly difficult. He came back for him and for us fans. To tell you the truth once he really retires it will be extremly difficult to purchase a new rap cd. I love old school rap. Ice cube. 50. Dr.dre. Then eminem. I don't feel the love that comes from anyone else's music. And for me that's real"
