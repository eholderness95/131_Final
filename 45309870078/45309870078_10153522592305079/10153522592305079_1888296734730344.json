        "message": "Hi, I'm not really sure how to do this, let me just waffle and hope it comes out right.  I have a friend called Lee, whose mother died when he was 6, and his father dumped him into care, he was abused etc, you know how it goes..he has no other family and I took him in when he ended up homeless.  He calls me his dad, but I'm not related.  Trouble is every birthday he tends to self harm or attempt suicide, and I'm afraid one day he'll succeed, his birthday is 4th June...what I am wondering is whether you can do something to help me get him through this year, I don't really know what, I'm clutching at straws.  He is a huge fan and he might listen/enjoy something special.  I don't know what else to say, and I hate asking, but please and thank you in advance (please note I am sending this to his 3 or 4 favourite artists in the hope someone will respond).  Thank you, Jude (Julian, the not dad, dad)."
