        "message": "Hi Eminem, I'm a big fan. You are an incredibly talented person, and a future icon. I'm writing to humbly ask you to consider providing a brief foreword to my upcoming definitive biography, 'Captain Fantastic: Elton John in the 1970s'. I've interviewed nearly 60 people for this respectful, exhaustively-researched book, including nearly every musician Elton worked with in the '70s (as well as his late/great producer, Gus Dudgeon), and having your thoughts added to this work would be invaluable. Please feel free to get in touch. - Best, David \n\n// email: SonicCandyLuxe@gmail.com \n// mobile: 480-334-0330\n// Facebook: David John DeCouto"
