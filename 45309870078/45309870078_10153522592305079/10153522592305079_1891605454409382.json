I love to see a person [sasquatch or human] hold a rock, touch a rock, speak the word rock, toss a rock, climb a rock, stack rocks into a sandwhich, and of course read words carved into rock - the best part of Art History.\n\ntoday find a rock. can you? do you live near a rock? ever seen a rock in real life? know where to find a rock?\n\nrock rock rock dare you to say it and point to what charlie is standing upon.\n\nthen after that we can play rock paper scissors.\n\nor will you be like the other 300 people I met since 2002 I've asked to play rock paper scissors with and whom did not.\n\npretty sickening that Minnesota and Wisconsin have no one to offer to play a lowsy stinking game of rock paper scissors."
