Without ever showing a bad attitude, she did exactly what she was told, never stomped her feet, and always found beauty in life \u2013 even in her cold, lonely tower bedroom. A few miles away, lived acompletely perfect prince who was just aching to find the woman of hisdreams. He knew she was out there, but he was growing weary with all the imperfect, ugly women in his kingdom. One day, this perfect girl escaped the walls of herprison and, with the help of a fairy godmother and some animals, she made her way to his palace. He sawher in the distance. He ran through the sea of eligible maidens, sweeping every other woman aside,and took this girl in his arms. Slowlythey begin dancing farther and farther away from the crowd, singing, \u201cSo this is love\u2026hum mm mm mm\u2026so this is loooove.\u201d Amazing! They\u2019re already in love! They looked at each other and knew! When love is true you just know, right? You don\u2019t have to question it, don\u2019t have to pray about it, don\u2019t need to get to know each other, and don\u2019t need to seek wise counsel\u2026 you just know! Sadly,the perfect girl runs off into the dark night without so much as telling the perfect prince her name,but never fear\u2026 fate steps in and finds that same perfect girl (the one with perfect, dainty, lovely feet), she and the perfect prince marry, and then the perfect pair lives happily ever after."
