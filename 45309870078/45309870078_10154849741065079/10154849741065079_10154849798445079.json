Next week someone else will pull some dumb stunt. The regressive left lost their minds this election when a communist didn't win. They've been so brainwashed and pussified  for the last 8 years that they actually believe the media which continuously spews that agenda driven crap trickled down by the people that truly run the world. They got you all fooled the left and the right. More so the left because theyre so emotional and out of control right now. Listen to the the BET rap again and basically you hear the same virtue signaling bullshit that EVERY single leftist Hollywood scumbag says. 1. He's racist 2. He's orange 3. He hates immigrants 4. He's going to nuke the world 5. Bashing southerners 6. Gun control etc.. Fuckin guy sounds like CNN. For a guy that made lots of money rapping about guns it's pretty hypocritical calling for gun control."
