        "message": "I have loved Eminem since I was a teenager.....mid 30s now......I thought I'd always love his music.......until today. I saw the \"trump\" song.......I thought you were better than all the sheep in this country. I actually thought that you thought for yourself and didn't listen to everyone else.......p.s., no form of gun control or reform would have made a difference in las Vegas. What could have made a difference? Maybe the bellhop should have spoke up instead of being greedy when he was given $100 tips from the guy. Or anyone else employed there, anyone could have spoken up about his odd behavior and the odd amount of \"luggage\" he had.........."
