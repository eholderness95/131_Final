I knows this factually. The majority of the whites left due to land reform. A process that would involve being forced from their farms with zero compensation, beatings, rape and many shot dead. The blacks have left because of that result. Most of those lands were given to Mugabes cronies who are completely clueless about farming/agriculture and have now left that country and it's hard working natives starving, jobless and with zero future. Zimbabwes inflation rate is labeled as hyperinflation, and is measured in the hundreds of millions percent. Nobody can survive that lifestyle, and I don't blame any of them for leaving, regardless of race."
