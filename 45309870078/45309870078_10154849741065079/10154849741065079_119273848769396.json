        "message": "#Eminem has long pointed out how shitty our #government is and how corrupt it has become. Much of which has been shadowed by his outrageous wit. At the same time he has always stood for America. You have the ability to #resist corruption, and at the same time love your country. This is where most righty\u2019s get confused, and their little brains begin to hurt. #Kaepernick and his peers sit down because the government has failed to recognize a multitude of issues. It has NOTHING to do with his love of his #country. Failing to see this makes you a simpleton. But anyway, grateful for Eminem using his platform to point out the hypocrisy and bullshit that is happening in the #WhiteHouse. I can\u2019t wait for his new album to drop in hopes there is more of this. #fuckTrump #fuckthegovernment  #USA #fuckthesimpletons"
