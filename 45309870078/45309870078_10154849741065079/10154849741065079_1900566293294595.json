I'm from the UK and Trump just seems so far from the norm that it's hard to comprehend.\nTo me he comes across as a fundamentally bad person. His tweets today against NBC and CNN were chilling and seem totally against the First Amendment. He's also starting a trade war with Canada and the UK. This sucks because we're supposed to be allies.\nSo, what am I missing? Is there a good side to Trump?"
