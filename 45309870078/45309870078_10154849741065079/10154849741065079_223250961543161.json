He has always been a philanthropist as much as Oprah & others but unlike them he did not bring attention to it.\nMany of these people came forward since he has been persecuted like he has by Eminem, who has some of the most violent lyrics out there.\nEminem has openly admitted to such rage as wanting to kill his mother.\nEminem has also made millions from Americans that is a good salary getting paid to air all of your thoughts & opinions.\nI feel very much compassion for those in entertainment today who are all boarding the great Titanic of hate & Illuminati....\nWe must never forget no matter how greatly intelligent we are..\nWe are not above Jesus Christ.\nChrist enabled us to have all we have. \nLike Eminem, who God or satan gave great influence & he has thus far used it for immediate gratification of beats & chill bumps & rage.\nIt is temporary.\n\nAnything done in Christ lasts forever. \nIt is eternal.\nGod bless you...we have a right given by Christ to either believe or not to believe."

Trump does not need money.\n\nNow, the Clinton's needed money, as proven . \nScandal after scandal.\nAnd you good people crucify a billionaire who truly loves America.\nAnd if ANYONE deserves a Presidential salary it is this President.\nYou know, I very much disliked Obama but I respected the Office and I believe he loves his wife & children. There is something good in even the worst of us usually, but what makes this SO \"\"Jesus & Barnabas\"\" (Clinton's being Barnabas) is you good people REFUSE to credit this man anything.\n\nBut money is not even my main issue.\n\nEminem who will answer for his platform of influence...spews rage & violence to the youth of this world?? And made millions doing it.\n\nPlease address Eminem REPEATEDLY spewing hate, violence & rage....even until current day, still immature perception...\nWe will never come together the way Eminem is doing it...\nMartin Luther King is still respected today because he was NOT DIVISIVE.\nJesus Christ is the only reason I'm not .\nJesus Christ is all that matters.\nHe is King.\nNot money, fame or knowledge. We will never be ABOVE our Creator. \n\nBut Donald J. Trump needing money is a complete non issue for me personally bc I believe he is a giver. \nPeople hated Abraham Lincoln vehemently, he upset entertainers & media as well...\n\nAnd for Eminem to talk like a \"country white\" person when he came out of a trailer park AND welfare....and secondly, middle aged Americans are who made him a millionaire...\nI mean who in this comparison is the selfish person? \nI say none of this with hatred in my heart, hate is not going to help but put an end to America."
