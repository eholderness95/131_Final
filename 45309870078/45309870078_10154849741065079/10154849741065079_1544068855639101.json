        "message": "Hey Eminem , now that you have told many such as myself to go fuck myself because we don't share your political views. We could not agree to vote for a candidate caught in the worst or worst scandals , plus helped her husband destroy countless woman he had sexually assaulted etc. Made literally over a hundred million dollars as a Secretary of State ? Anyway , I personally have spent well over a hundred bucks on your music etc over the years , and since you do not want me as a fan and I should go fuck myself , I would think the only decent thing to do is refund me my money. Not to worry , I will never , ever allow one penny of my money to find it's way your direction and will ensure all the like minded people as myself clearly get your message and do the same."

Eminem has made significant money off his fans , and he turns around and tells half of those fans to fuck off unless they hate Trump. To say that was dumb is an understatement ( the NFL is learning that lesson and they didn't go anywhere near this far). Look at this way , if Eminem had attacked queer snowflakes and said unless you support Hilary fuck off, you would be losing your mind , even though I am straight , I would still think that was wrong and defend you as i don't believe in dividing the nation and attacking people just because of who they voted for in the election."
