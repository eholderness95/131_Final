        "message": "Glad you drew your line in the sand. Because all those kids that you say \"look like me\" and \"talk like me\" just quit buying your sh!t. And, in your song White America, said you can do math \"selling double the records\" Yup, not anymore. YOU ARE creating racial lines, Racial unity had succeeded, hence your WHOLE existence. NOW, you're being a puppet for those who aim to destroy it-dumb-a. Find better raw,underground talent on Youtube these days. You are not \"one of us\" anymore, and it shows. The failing record will speak for itself."
