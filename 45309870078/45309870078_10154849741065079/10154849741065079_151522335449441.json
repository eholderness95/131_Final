Not to mention, you will see more Caucasian, Hispanics, Asians on commercial breaks than on the actual shows."

You have free range you know. You can go to school, get a good education and get whatever job you want in life. The only thing holding you back is yourself and your perception that you are owed something because of the color of your skin. You're the racist. You are the problem. Would it be racist to open a network called WET? The black communities would be screaming about it. I'm so sick of the hypocrisy. sit down and stfu."
