        "message": "Hahaha from the comments it looks like you chose the wrong side Em. To bad dude,but Trump isn't a racist or any of that. You would rather believe the garbage then take 5 minutes to look for yourself. That's ignorance. 5 minutes of research will blow your little mind on what Trump has done for non white communities. So if you say choose you or the further of this country, I'm pretty sure your gonna lose. Just sayin lol"
