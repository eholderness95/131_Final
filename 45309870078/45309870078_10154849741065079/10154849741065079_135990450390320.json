        "message": "\"Guess Em forgot his first few months on the job, how he was accused of racism, stereotyping, stealing culture, and being a straight up honkey. A white rapper, oh at the beatings that dude took on the radio! How critics would say \"You cannot be a fan of rap/ hip hop and be a fan of Eminem.\" He was hated just as bad as Trump in the beginning, radio stations didn't give em airplay, he was attacked by the left as misogynistic, sexist, homophobic and all those other great words they like to use, even a white supremacist because he was taking airplay, record sales, and opportunities from black men. Eminem... a white supremacist! LMAO\n\nGood thing we didn't listen to them, Em. We stood our ground then and you became one of the greatest ever.\nI'm tired of people trying to divide us, we don't all fit into little neat boxes, Em. You of all people should understand that.\""
