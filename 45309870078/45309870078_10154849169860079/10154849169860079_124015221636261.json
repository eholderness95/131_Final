        "message": "Courtesy of Ras Kass: \n\n\"no disrespect to the homey Em  but I find it amazingly insulting  how #Keitholbermann and BET (owned by white Viacom) can co-opt and #whitewash political Hiphop when bros like myself Immortal Technique & K_rino and others have consistently been doing the grassroots work lyrically. The BET Hip Hop Awards 2017 Online are laughable at best. Especially after 10 yrs of promoting #niggery !! Wow This is all Sham.\""
