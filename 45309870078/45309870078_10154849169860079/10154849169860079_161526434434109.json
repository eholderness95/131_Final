        "message": "Eminem's whole point was to send a message. What if he wasn't actually literally trying to curse people out, but rather trying to get ppl to wake up to whats going on? The bigger msg was to open ppls eyes over stuff going on..not to curse out ppl. But of course, that small piece of the song is  being focused on. Your reaction to last part of it, was the same as the NFL players when the president called them SOBs. So you are allowed to react this way, and they aren't? Double standard. I gave trump a real shot. He is blowing it, bc he is not for the entire country, he only wants  to President for some of you. You either get it or you don't. Again, the thing to focus on, is the issues he talks about, not the fact he is cursing ppl out."
