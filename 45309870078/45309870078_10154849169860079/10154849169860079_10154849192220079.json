I hope you understand it better now.\n\nLets investigate the first word you used -> CORNY\n\n'(especially of jokes, films, stories, etc.) showing no new ideas or too often repeated, and therefore not funny or interesting.'\n\nWell now, i wrote that little text above because i am frustrated, by bullies, by war, by people doing bad to other people, by people which you confront with reality and their answer is 'i'll beat you up' or they just hit you in the face.\n\nOne thing you should ask yourself, when did hitting someone in the face ever changed something? \n\nThis is the on the same atrocity level as someone going to shoot someone else. Violence is like driving with 300mph against a wall without using a break. It might be over quick but most of the time you survive and live with the consequences.\n\nViolence and with it Ignorance are the poison of humanity.\n\nIf you feel you can't live without it, go to jail but stop playing monopoly you already lost and son, stay away from that car."
