Even if he doesn't want me as a fan.\nI wrote something in a language that he can understand,\nI doubt he'll ever see it but everyone's got a dream man. Hopefully even if he doesn't y'all can enjoy it.\n\nDivide:\n\nWe're now entering a time,\nWhere people are being,\nMore vocal about what's on their mind,\nThe Red and blue side,\nHow did we get here? Let's Rewind,\nSo much hate and division,\nBecause of our opinions,\nIt's gone from jokes and jest,\nTo a mothafuckin' mess,\n\nCalling everyone a racist,\nGod knows they don't deserve it,\nOr \"liberal idiot\"! \n\"A Stupid feminist\"!\nLet's put the insults aside,\nAnd read between the lines,\nGood people on either side,\nBut now not even alive,\nTheir Souls are dead,\nConsumed by the politics,\nThere once was a time even I was involved in it,\nBut slowly I grew sick,\nBit by bit,\nOf all the mud slinging,\nFists swinging,\nAlarm bells in the back of my mind ringing,\nWords stinging,\nHow many death threats,\nHas your president received yet?\nHow can you be so evil so someone your ain't met?\nBeing a president once got you only respect,\nAnd maybe I just need to get with the times,\nBut honestly something feels wrong about this in my mind.\n\nWe're now entering a time,\nWhere people are being,\nVocal about what's on their mind,\nThe Red and blue side,\nHow did we get here? Let's Rewind,\nSo much hate and division,\nBecause of our opinions,\nIt's gone from jokes and jest,\nTo a mothafuckin' mess,\n\nHow can you turn your back on so many of your fans,\nSome been around since 19-96 man,\nAnd I haven't been here for long,\nBut honestly what saved me,\nWas one of your songs,\nNow don't get the hump, \nCos I ain't support Trump,\nI'd vote for him over Hillary,\nIs that why you're killin' me?\nOr is it just for controversy?\nI loved \"Not Afraid\",\nAnd all that funny shit that Shady made,\nI will never understand your pain,\nBut I know you always had the media against your name,\nSo how could you go along with this?\nAnd get involved in this shit?\nMan, I know you've got your reasons,\nBut is it worth alienating those who loved you till recent?\nWhat if Hailie had a different view?\nWould you hate her and disown her as your daughter too?\nI see you got a rage,\nAnd you're feeling all the pain,\nFrom all those that Donald's Wronged,\nBut is it worth killing your fans that you wrote about in your songs?\n\nWe're now entering a time,\nWhere people are being,\nVocal about what's on their mind,\nThe Red and blue side,\nHow did we get here? Let's Rewind,\nSo much hate and division,\nBecause of our opinions,\nIt's gone from jokes and jest,\nTo a mothafuckin' mess,\n\nYou're opening the door,\nFor more civil war,\nEach side thinking they know what should be law,\nEach side thinking they honestly know a little more,\nNow I ain't no villain,\nBut I'm sick of people thinking I wanna kill em,\nTrust me I ain't no artist,\nI know that, I'm honestly not retarded,\nI just need to vent,\nI'm sure hate is not what you meant,\nBut it came across like you was Hellbent,\nOn making sure other people were Hell-sent,\nLet's stop being divided,\nAs a community be united,\nSkip the politics,\nEnjoy the little bits,\nRespect others visions,\nAnd let them have their opinions,\nStop the media race-bait,\nStop all the hate,\nAnd Em,\nDespite this dispute,\nImma let you know that I'm still rooting for you,\nWhether you think it's wrong,\nI'm still gon listen to your songs."
