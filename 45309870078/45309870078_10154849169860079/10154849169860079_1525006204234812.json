I have been a fan ever since and defended you in your attacks on women, mothers, politics etc. But I hear you loud and clear. Despite the fact that I voted for Bill twice and Obama twice, because I chose Trump this time around for my own personal reasons, I am not wanted as your fan. No problem. You won't be benefiting from me or mine and you became a family favorite. I am a 46 year old white mother of two married for 27 years with two grown children. FUCK YOU SLIM SHADY."

But him saying He doesn\u2019t Want Trump supporters as fans, and saying f you to them is kind of a kick in the face to those who supported him. You know the ones, the fans him and the celebs thAnk in the speeches they make. Is Chrysler, who he made a commercial for, going to now say Trump supporters don\u2019t go and buy our cars? No. Why? It\u2019s not about Trump it\u2019s about money and album sales. We really don\u2019t know if he feels the way that he says he does anyway. So don\u2019t fool yourself. For all you know, he could\u2019ve voted for him, if he even voted. It\u2019s no secret if you support Trump in the entertainment business, you get blackballed. It\u2019s not about what\u2019s right to them, it\u2019s about what\u2019s popular..He doesn\u2019t owe us anything, and we surely don\u2019t owe him either."
