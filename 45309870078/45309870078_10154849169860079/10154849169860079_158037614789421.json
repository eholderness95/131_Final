Yo, funny thing is, most of your listeners are white lol. I've heard a few of my black friends talking shit about you and hating on you because you're white and they don't like white rappers. I am not racist by the way. I have friends of all colors and nationalities and im Puerto Rican. But you drawing a line and telling most of your fans to go fuck themselves only shows you're nothing but an egomaniac who is now making things worse by dividing people even more than they already are. You were truly one of my favorite rappers and i still think you are. But your mentality is whack and you officially sold out your originality to be like everyone else from this generation. \nBy the way, fuck you too."
