All they were to you was another artist who should have stuck to music.\n\nEminem stick to music.\nAthlete stick to sports. \nActors and Actresses stick to Acting. \nBut for some reason they all didn\u2019t tell Trump to stick to reality TV and bankruptcy. \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14"

He brushed off maybe 5% of his fan base to boost the popularity with the other 95%. Talking shit about someone that 45% of the people and 95% of your fan base is already talking shit about is about as pussy as it gets. \n\nIf he was brave he would have said at least something while Obama was in. Yet... fuck all."
