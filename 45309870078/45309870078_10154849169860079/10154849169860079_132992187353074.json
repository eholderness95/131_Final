You're an entertainer and you have no more rights than I do unless you buy them. Sell out racist against whites... But oh no let me not offend you or anyone else i forgot it's 2017 everybody gets booty hurt over virtually everything. You're too old to be sticking your nose where it doesn't belong. You only exist because of your fans dipshit. Stick to your day job mister rap artist and stay out of politics."
