Trump came in to put together, even though the shitty weather. Media lying,got called out, they no longer carry clout . Democrats being called out on all types of crimes, their party is turning dropping dimes. brainwashed snowflakes in denial, when we gonna see Hillary's trial? She thought she had the votes , voters turned out and she got smoked! lol"
