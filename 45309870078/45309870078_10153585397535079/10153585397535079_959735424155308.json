        "message": "As I sit back and think of all the struggles I've surpassed\nLong nights on the streets only the strong will last\nLife ripped apart by mistakes but my hope has been lifted\nThese blessing along the way for the Lord has been gifted\nHe gives me strength in my veins and calms my soul\nTook the demons out of my life and made me once again whole \nHe overlooked all the bad and never judged me one day\nI thank him daily as I drop to my knees and pray\nI started from the bottom but I'm heading for the stars \nLeave the bullshit behind all that's left is the scars\nMemories along the way are there to remind me of the past\nLiving life to the fullest everyday like it's my last\nThey say what don't kill you makes you stronger and builds strength along the way\nAlways appreciate what you have and be thankful your here everyday\nIt can all be taken in a second no matter who you are\nAll the money in the world can only get you so far\nRespect is the key, be humble and always do what is right\nPut faith in the Lord and don't forget to thank him every night\nHe's watching over us all and never judges or compares\nYou only get one life no since of living scared\nDecision along the way bring us up or make us fall\nEverything happens for a reason there's a chance for us all\n\nI write alot of poems and lyrics and would love a chance to write for you im one of your biggest fans.
