        "message": "Michael Jackson used to sell many people back in the day! He would do that because he did not want them to make it big like him. Michael had to be the best. Michael would get people wrapped in lots of bad business deals and trapped...Michael was a self taught dancer! When he would do this type of dance move he would be saying in code to sell this or that type of person down the street...He use to sell people off the stage at times! I figured this out years ago when i was studying Michael back when i was a kid. Michael was an expert at acting!"
