How does he post dumb stuff. He is working with these people.. Lol he's posting memes (which I love memes but Eminem knows that is posting memes will be irrelevant to his career) if he knows what memes are which I doubt no diss because we all know he doesn't fuck with computers lol but be patient though bro Eminem needs to feel like there is something to say to drop something, so it looks like things are going good for him now and I'm glad and proud"
