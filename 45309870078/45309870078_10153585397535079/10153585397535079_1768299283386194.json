        "message": "I am 43 years old and have been one of your biggest fans for the last 16 years,i went to both concerts you did in Melbourne Australia and was going to go to the one 14 years ago but alas it got cancelled.Whilst at the first concert standing in line next to 15 year old girls they asked me how could someone my age like you,they sat there telling me how sexy you are and i replied saying would you fuck your fathers friend?Because Eminem is old enough to be your father and that's what it would be like.That shut them up.I absolutely love you and would be ecstatic and extremely grateful if you replied to me.I know your busy but please reply to a STAN FAN.Love you heaps Slim.Laurel Baugh"
