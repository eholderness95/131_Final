        "message": "Something i have thought for a long time now is that the animuguses in Harry Potter where humans go morph into an animal and pretend to be animal for awhile for the purpose of deceiving other humans, well i have thought for a while that those types do exist and they work as deep cover people for governments across the planet and are not talked about by the earths general news media people! They are kept very secret among the general public! I am just educating the general public on things! I once said i wanted us to set up something a lot like a Harry Potter and Star Wars planet across the Earth!"

But... idk if any work for the government, I doubt it cuz Shapeshifters are very Spiritual and peaceful people, so I doubt they would want to work for the government, unless they were captured by them and they forced them to work for them. That's why I try to keep a low profile, I dont wanna end up as a lab Rat or some shit, lol. I am one of the most famous forms of Shapeshifters though, aka a Werewolf! Arctic Wolf actually!  :)"

We would mainly do it to travel faster, hunt for food, learn things, excetra. We are not evil or witches or wizards or any of that crap, just Spiritually connected wise Beings. We are actually more like caretakers of Nature and all Living Things."
