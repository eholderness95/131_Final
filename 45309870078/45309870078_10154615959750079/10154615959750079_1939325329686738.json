        "message": "Eminem is just the like Earl Sweatshirt,  are very good with flow,  multis,  wordplay,  but what hold them back is that they make very few meaningful songs,  and when they write some meaningful song,  you can clearly see that their lyrical abilities goes down tremendously,  just compare songs like \"I am back to Mockingbird\",  but I am not sayin tht they are wack,  cause it also takes alot of skill to rhyme the way they do, all I am trying to say is tht for me particularly there is no rap king, cause each rapper has an ability tht the others dont have,  so Its a matter of choice,  if u fuck with rhyme schemes,  Them Eminem,  Earl Sweatshirt,  MF Doom etc are your guys,  but If you into meaningful rap songs,  then Kendrick,  Joey Badass, J cole etc are your guys... peace"
