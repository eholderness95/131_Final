I remember writing in my room alone or places outside.... before sitting in my room and listening to music... that didn't happen until I was a teenager really that I took a big interest in music cause I was outside a ton as a kid... while our mom was at \"work\" whatever that means looking back now...sometimes this how you create your own beat and rhythms is in your own silence."
