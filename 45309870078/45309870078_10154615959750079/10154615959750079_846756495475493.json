        "message": "Ran across this interview on my news feed. Got me back looking up all the music I have missed since I bought Relapse in early 2011 when I PCS'd from Alaska to Georgia. Listen to that CD most of the two week long trip (made a few stops lol). Your music has always been great. Guess it's time to get a new iPod (my shuffle is just as old and the last cd I bought lol) and download ALL the albums...hoping they have them on iTunes. lol it will be great music to get me through the next 3 months! #deployedlife #bringingbackthegoodshit"
