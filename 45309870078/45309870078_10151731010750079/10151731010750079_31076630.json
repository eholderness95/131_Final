        "message": "Just listened to the new album (yeah it dates me, but still not that much older than E) and thought is was very good and so damn hilarious I almost peed myself driving down a MASS hwy!! I mean that it a good way..the lyrics to old songs, busted up laughing yet E proud!! Gotta love him!!!! PS E, if you could tell me why I do not see the red slim shady hoddies, I would greatly appreciate it!! Red is my favorite color and it appears that you are the only one who can get one (which is totally understandable), your label after all!!! Ending with I LOVE the new music, way to mix it up!!!"
