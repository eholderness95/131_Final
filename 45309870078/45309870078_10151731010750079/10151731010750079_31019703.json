        "message": "Bought it on it's release day.....Rap God is the epitome of everything Eminem has been, is and ever will be. Not to say he's at his peak, but it would definitely take a God to top it, and there are only demigods in the presence of the great Eminem. When the fuck is he touring in Pittsburgh?! I would spend a years salary just to have a conversation with you about the way your music has influenced, and been an integral part of my life since the Slim Shady EP when I was 13. Shady, Mr. Mathers, Eminem no matter what you go by I will always feel a connection to you as our childhoods were very similar."
