Not a pop-heavy rapper. In a world full of mumble rappers the last thing we need is someone like eminem collaborating with pop stars. Did you see jay z have any gay pop collaborations? Not on his most recent album. I'm keeping my hopes up but am highly skeptical that this album will be any better than the last 3 ones. Hope I am proved wrong."
