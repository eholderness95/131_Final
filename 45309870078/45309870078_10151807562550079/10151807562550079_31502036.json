        "message": "Eminem is better than Tupac, compare their rhyming skills. PAC could never come like eminem on Rap God or Forever, Soldier, The Way I Am, Role Model, 3AM, Till I Collapse, Renegade, Dead Wrong, FUCKING \"Nail in The Coffin\" or The Sauce. Come on Man PAC was great, but all race bullshit aside Eminem will be inducted into the Rock and Roll hall of fame just like Run DMC and Public Enemy because of his IMPACT on hip-hop. Neither PAC nor Biggie are or ever will be inducted. It would of happened by now. And what's wrong with the song \"Bad Guy\"? Your trippin hard to say that song is wack. Damn where's your artistic view, some people have no damn ear for good music. And fuck I miss 90s hip-hop too. But remember Eminem dropped Infinate in 1996 and The Slim Shady LP in 1999. He started and blew in the 90's. I also miss 90s rock, like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. I'm a student of all great music."
