        "message": "Some Polish people decide to start a chicken farm. They get some chickens and plant them in the ground, headfirst. When all the chickens die, the farmers are somewhat confused, but they don't give up.\nThey get some more chickens, but these are planted feet-first. It takes a little longer, but eventually the second batch of chickens die, too.\nThey decide to write a letter to the Polish agriculture bureau.
