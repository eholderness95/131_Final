        "message": "My amazing uncle Mario Valle has been tirelessly fighting for his life for over 12 years. His strong and ruthless opponent, Kidney failure. Both of Uncle Mario's kidneys began to fail when he was only 42 due to his genetic high blood pressure ! Since then, with the support of his loving family and friends he's been trying to hold on, but sadly it's not enough. The doctors have told us with confidence that he doesnt have much time left on this earth. I refuse to let him go without a fight. I am now forced to ask for a hand from good people like you. Please consider donating to this cause to save his life! All donations, small are large are greatly appreciated and give Uncle Mario a reason to hold on. If you cant donate anything please give this comment a like and share it. Thank you and have a blessed day \nDonate here! \ngofund.me/sd2t2t2s"
