        "message": "43 years old and he's still a rap god. You just lose yourself and go bezerk listening to his music.\nAnyway, hi, my name is Katie. I'm not afraid to say this, even though I'm probably just talking to myself, but Marshal, you really are the real slim shady. Anyone who has no love for you is a total asshole. You're so much better than any of the other rappers I've ever heard, and your songs are always on fire. Just like you, kings never die. And by kings, I mean gods, cause you are one.\nHappy 43rd birthday, Eminem!\n-Katie\nP.S. I hid twelve of your songs in the message. I also hope you remember we all love you, Marshal."
