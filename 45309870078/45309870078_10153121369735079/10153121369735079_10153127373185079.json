Everything starts to look different,Even the wind which touches my face has a different smell,Its like it calls me to live the life,and brings me back all the memories,lyrics and everything which is linked with him ! Because  Before 43 years ago,Someone special joined this world,That little  innocent guy, Got  a name ! It name was written to be '' Marshall Mather''\nHis Story was said to be like that, It was written for him to have a very tought life,To grow up poorly,Without two  people,Who must have had  taken care of  him and must have given him the the most important thing , The Real  Love \nAnyway, He showed everybody that he  is strong enough  and able to resist everything the life had prepared for him \nThat's why he is here,with us,inspiring us,giving us the  power to get better ! To try,To fail and to try again,Thats how the life works, You do always fail,but you shouldnt never give up ! Thats one of the most important things he had  tought to me,To us,To stans ! \nThat's why  our love for him is Immortable and infinite\nI fucked it up ! I just wanted to  Say happy birthday to u, but when i started talking about u , i realised that there are much more things i should say about u ! You cant  understand how much i love you ! I Really love u, We all love you, We,We are the  STANS,That's how our family is said to be \nHowEver !!!!! I WISH You ALL THE BEST , Keep  Being yourself, The best  \nHAPPY BIRTHDAY !  A UNDYABLE LEGEND ! THE RAP GOD"
