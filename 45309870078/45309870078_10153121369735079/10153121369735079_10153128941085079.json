I wanna take a minute to say thank you to Marshall Bruce Mathers III Slim Shady Eminem Em Rap Boy Cinderella Man for being the passion and love and fantasy and the strength that I need whenever I need it. You make me run harder on the treadmill, You make me study harder for tests, You make me not afraid of my fears, You make me believe in myself, You tell me it's okay to be crazy, You show me how to own who I am and to love myself and stop thinking about my doubts. You help me turn my anger into fuel to keep going. I love you more than words have the power to express. I owe you the world \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Happy Birthday to my Teacher"
