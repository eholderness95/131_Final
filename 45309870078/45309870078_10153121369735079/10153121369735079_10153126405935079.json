        "message": "Too bad you never knew that you're too good for me, Too bad you never picked a higher quality lady to write about, You'd rather sit around and pout about a relationship you never had, than to go absolutely madand crazy about the the most unique true lady the world has ever seen- Cause Skylar writes way better than me, and she is classy and stays single for you, she's your army and your fortress and she has so much attitude and truth to her, but you don't want her because she's not with someone else- the only time you ever wanted me was when I was with my true love- my emotional savior - my Chuck E. - my Baby who I can't wait to see."
