        "message": "Happy birthday Eminem\nWell, I Will Make A Huge Post Since Im A Stan \nHere We Go \nEminems music is \"Beautiful\", i will \"Forever\" listen to it. So many artists out thr are \"Despicable\" and \"So Bad\", they make me want to \"Puke\". BTW, im \"Not Afraid\" to tell anyone tht \"Marshall Mathers\"\ufeff is my favorite rapper. Right now hes \"On Fire\" and anyone who says other wise is \"Brain Damaged\" and a \"Big Weenie\". His lyrics are \"Insane\" and you \"Lose Yourself\" in them in every song. You can\ufeff hate on me, but i won't let you be a \"Bully\". I am \"The Way I Am\", and I \"Won't Back Down\"."
