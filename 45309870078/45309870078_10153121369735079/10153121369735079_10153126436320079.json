At that time I did not even knew u. Then one day I heard your song 'not afraid' it inspired me so much. After that I no more afraid of those fucking seniors and I beat them black and blue. Not that I was not beaten I too got hurt but I learned that there are things u should not be afraid of.\nSir I know that u are busy with ur work but if u can please reply.\n                                  A True Stan"
