        "message": "Marshall Bruce Mathers. You are turning 43 today. I've been waited a long time for this moment. You changed my life. You inspired me. Meeting you or even just to see you is my biggest dream. Your songs make me happy, excited and sometimes emotional. You saved a lot of people's life. Your return to musi is made us the happiest fanbase in the world. You're my idol for 2 years Sometimes i see you as a father. I'm excited for writing this. I'll send this letter to you and maybe you'll read. You don't know who i am or how much i love you. I'm so proud of being an Eminem fan. I'll keep loving you forever. I watch your all videos with joy, and not to be able to see you hurts me so bed ..  #HappyBrithdayEminem"
