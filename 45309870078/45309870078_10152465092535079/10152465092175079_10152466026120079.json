        "message": "Look, if you had, one shot, or one opportunity\nTo seize everything you ever wanted, one moment\nWould you capture it?\nOr just let it slip, yo\nHis palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti\nHe's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready\nTo drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'\nWhat he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud\nHe opens his mouth, but the words won't come out\nHe's choking, how? Everybody's joking now\nThe clock's run out, times up, over, blaoh!\nSnap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity\nOh, there goes Rabbit He choked, he's so mad but he won't\nGive up that easy, he knows, he won't have any notes\nHis whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope\nHe knows that but he's broke, he so stagnant he knows\nWhen he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's\nBack to the lab again, yo\nThis whole rhapsody better go capture this moment\nAnd hope it don't pass him\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nHis soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping\nThis world is mine for the taking, make me king\nAs we move toward a new world order, a normal life is boring\nBut superstardom's close to post mortem\nIt only grows harder, homie grows hotter\nHe blows. It's all over, these hoes is all on him\nCoast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter lonely roads\nGod only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father\nHe goes home and barely knows his own daughter\nBut hold your nose cause here goes the cold water\nThese hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product\nThey moved on to the next schmoe who flows\nHe nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera is told it unfolds\nI suppose it's all over, but the beat goes on\nDa da dum, da dum da da da\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nNo more games, I'ma change what you call rage\nTear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged\nI was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed\nI've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage\nBut I kept rhyming and stepped, writing the next cypher\nBest believe somebody's paying the pied piper\nAll the pain inside amplified by the fact\nThat I can't get by with my 9 to 5\nAnd I can't provide the right type of life for my family\nCause man, these fucking food stamps don't buy diapers\nAnd it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life\nAnd these times are so hard and it's getting even harder\nTrying to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter\nCaught up between being a father and a prima donna\nBaby mama drama's screaming on and too much for me to wanna\nStay in one spot, another day of monotony's\nGotten me to the point I'm like a snail\nI've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot\nSuccess is my only motherfucking option, failure's not\nMom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go\nI cannot grow old in 'Salem's lot, so here I go it's my shot\nFeet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better\nYou can do anything you set your mind to, man\n\nRead more: Eminem - Lose Yourself Lyrics | MetroLyrics"
