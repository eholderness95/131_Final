Or just let it slip, yo His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now The clock's run out, times up, over, blaoh! Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity Oh, there goes Rabbit He choked, he's so mad but he won't Give up that easy, he knows, he won't have any notes His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope He knows that but he's broke, he so stagnant he knows When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's Back to the lab again, yo This whole rhapsody better go capture this moment And hope it don't pass him You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping This world is mine for the taking, make me king As we move toward a new world order, a normal life is boring But superstardom's close to post mortem It only grows harder, homie grows hotter He blows. It's all over, these hoes is all on him Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter lonely roads God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father He goes home and barely knows his own daughter But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product They moved on to the next schmoe who flows He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera is told it unfolds I suppose it's all over, but the beat goes on Da da dum, da dum da da da You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo No more games, I'ma change what you call rage Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage But I kept rhyming and stepped, writing the next cypher Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper All the pain inside amplified by the fact That I can't get by with my 9 to 5 And I can't provide the right type of life for my family Cause man, these fucking food stamps don't buy diapers And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder Trying to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter Caught up between being a father and a prima donna Baby mama drama's screaming on and too much for me to wanna Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go I cannot grow old in 'Salem's lot, so here I go it's my shot Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better You"
