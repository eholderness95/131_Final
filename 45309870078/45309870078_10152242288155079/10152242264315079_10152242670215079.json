Where you going?\"\n\"I'm leaving you!\"\n\"No you ain't. Come back.\"\nWe're running right back.\nHere we go again\nIt's so insane cause when it's going good, it's going great\nI'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane\nBut when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped\nWho's that dude?\n\"I don't even know his name.\"\nI laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again\nI guess I don't know my own strength\n\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's alright because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's alright because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\n\nYou ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em\nYou meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em\nGot that warm fuzzy feeling\nYeah, them chills you used to get 'em\nNow you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em\nYou swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em\nNow you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them\nYou push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em\nThrow 'em down, pin 'em\nSo lost in the moments when you're in them\nIt's the rage that took over,\nIt controls you both\nSo they say you're best to go your separate ways\nGuess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday\nYesterday is over, it's a different day\nSound like broken records playing over but you promised her\nNext time you show restraint\nYou don't get another chance\nLife is no Nintendo game\nBut you lied again\nNow you get to watch her leave out the window\nGuess that's why they call it window pane\n\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's alright because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's alright because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\n\nNow I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean\nAnd we fall back into the same patterns, same routine\nBut your temper's just as bad as mine is\nYou're the same as me\nWhen it comes to love you're just as blinded\nBaby, please come back\nIt wasn't you, baby it was me\nMaybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems\nMaybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano\nAll I know is I love you too much to walk away though\nCome inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk\nDon't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk\nTold you this is my fault\nLook me in the eyeball\nNext time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall\nNext time? There won't be no next time!\nI apologize even though I know its lies\nI'm tired of the games I just want her back\nI know I'm a liar\nIf she ever tries to fucking leave again\nIm'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire\nI'm just gonna\n\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's alright because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's alright because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie"
