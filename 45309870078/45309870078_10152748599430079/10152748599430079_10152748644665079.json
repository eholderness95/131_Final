        "message": "That single immediately changed my life too, being a product of 1972 I had great parents who never censored the music I listened to growing up.  Mostly it was their music but in the 80's when guns and roses came out I was blown away, the with pearl jam in the 90's.  I had always been a music lover, but when you dropped I actually started \"listening\" to music and even songs that I had heard a thousand times before were different to me because I was listening to them it seemed like for the first time.  You are a brilliant wordsmith, a comedian (in my eyes), and I am so glad that you continue to do what you do.  My 21yr old and my 16yr old grew up listening to you.  Much love and respect."
