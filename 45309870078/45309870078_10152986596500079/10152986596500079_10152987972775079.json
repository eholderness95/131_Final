        "message": "\"my grand finale\" really? No more detox? I bet this is Detox but he realised there's no way it could live up to all the hype so he just changed the name to \"Compton\" and acted like he was inspired by a movie (pretty quick turn around to put a whole new album together). Fair enough too cuz even if he made something comparable to all eyez on me it still wouldn't live up to the hype surrounding Detox\n#strongeverything\nJosh Ridgway Ma'i Lampard Pomate Huy Quach Moe Eryilmaz Anthony Qan Hong"
