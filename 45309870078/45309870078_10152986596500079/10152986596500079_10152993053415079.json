        "message": "Hey Marshall I know other people run your facebook so this is actually tho a message to them.. My name is DJ iSoul and I produce music and also a solo artist hey kinda like you Em! Of course it's the people that believe in you and that belief is what gives you that drive to push forward and make nothing into something. Right? My music is everywhere and you will soon see me everywhere soon too. How do I know? Well look at my last name.. Music is in my family. It's my American right to play music. Somehow I will get a mix tape to you Em. I do alot of styles and would love to work with you. So this is a warning of my arrival. I know Mister Marshall is busy but so am I. I gotta prove myself. But you will me and hope to work with. Now you know me. Peace"
