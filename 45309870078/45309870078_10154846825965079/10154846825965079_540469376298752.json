        "message": "I'm just disappointed in fact that you thought this was ok. I've  bought or at least listen to ever track that this man had ever laid. He brought me through hard times with his words and his visions. He drew the line in the sand. Preach about unity, love and no war. Keep the people together when everything seems to be falling apart. Know the difference between an intelligent protest that gets people thinking instead of the coward stance the NFL has taken. So what if the man has shitty words.  He work hard since stepping through the doors. Obama caused the separation of race and I stood behind him.   Just know this.. this will be last time I'll ever hear your voice. You've lost a lifetime fan because of your words."
