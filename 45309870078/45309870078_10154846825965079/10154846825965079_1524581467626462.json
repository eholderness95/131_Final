If only everyone could engage in political debates with mutual respect we\u2019d learn so much more from each other and about each other so I very sincerely want to thank you for being respectful \u263a\ufe0f ... my issue is with Eminem finishing his freestyle with saying if we support trump we can go fuck our selves and he\u2019s drawing a line in the sand. If more people engaged in healthy debates instead of shutting down the second people don\u2019t agree, no one wins. Do I feel he has racist tendencies? Sure I also believe that the majority of people have to some degree racist tendencies of their own and only really show it when they\u2019re surrounded with loved ones they can trust. That\u2019s when the truth comes out whether it\u2019s a racist joke or when someone\u2019s driving and gets cut off in traffic and they vent in anger. There are many ways people can be racist. I\u2019m guilty of it to some degree as well in jokes that I may tell etc but am I a hateful person who won\u2019t bother with someone simply because they are not my race or color? Absolutely not. I always pride myself on liking everyone UNTIL they give me a reason not too."
