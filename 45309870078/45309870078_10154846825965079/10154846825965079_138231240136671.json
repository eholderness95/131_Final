As for you asking for your money back are you joking he's never going to ever do something like that that's like an Indian giver you gave money to listen to his music and now because he offended you you want your money back go lay down somewheres"

Trump talks kinda  like an idiot, well actually not much different than Eminem; BUT he will likely accomplish more great economic prosperity for the poor and under privileged than any president ever before.   Don't believe everything CNN or BET tells you because they only want to keep holding you back like they have for 100's of years."
