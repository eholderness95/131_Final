I'm a conservative that appreciated and supported your courage when faced with continual adversity!\nYou have \"the stage\" to unite us yet like many others you're taking the easy road!

He called mexicans rapists and drug dealers, he called for a ban on muslims, he called NFL players sons of bitches, he called neo-nazis fine people... Uh are you missing the point that M is trying to make? or you are just trying to hide your biases behind a unity rethoric?? I understand that the country is polarized, but that is not the liberals fault! are you really asking mexicans to unite with you behind a trumps presidency? are you asking muslims to rally behind trump after he tried to ban them from this country or at least their family members? are you asking jews to be patriotic americans after donald trump didnt condemn people carrying a nazi flag? are you asking black americans to bow down to yet another racist person in the name of country? if thats what you want us uniting under, then you really need to re-think what unity means to you! It s easy to speak of unity and solidarity when the hatred and vitriol dispersed by the president does not affect you! and it if it does affect you, then what are you doing?"

            "message": "1st, voting for Trump was simply the route for those of us who couldn't possibly vote for Clinton, amd rightfully so. She doesn't stand for anything and lies about everything and is surrounded by scandals. Liberals complain about Russia, why? Because they helped bring out evidence of corruption in the DNC? Why is it such a bad thing to expose corruption and show you truth? It's ONLY bad because YOUR political party lost, how petty is that? Be honest.\n\n2ndly, while I may not think Trump is the best and he could do better I don't buy into the whole \"trumps a racist sexist bigot\". I haven't seen any real proof of racism, he wants LEGAL immigration and controlled immigration, which considering how Canada & europe is doing with those is a great thing!\n\nWhen events happen he takes his time for facts to come to light before making a speech on them and after antifa/BLM/neo-nazis clashed he handled it VERY well. He called it what it was, two groups of hateful violent people meeting together. That's all both of those groups are, they show up looking for trouble. He actually did us a solid in terms of unity by pointing that out and blaming them all, as it should be.\n\nConsidering the last 8 years of Obamas constant division (especially in his last term) Trump isn't doing so bad. He could be handling foreign policys better though, but again I doubt Clinton would be doing much better (she wanted to go on a war path with Russia, no fly zone over syria).\n\nPeople just watch too much biased news and media. Liberal media will spew non sense into your head all damn day if you let it. Personally as someone who likes to stay WELL informed I do my own research and stick to facts and what was said and not how it makes you feel.\n\nPersonally I can do without Ems music, his old stuff was legendary but his new stuff is really hit and miss like most artist.\n\nPointless fucking typing this because anyone who disagrees will be so triggered by it that they won't make it half way through. Honestly not surprising anymore."

You look at both sides. I think there is blame object both on both sides. I have no doubt about it. You don't have doubt about it either. If you reported it accurately, you would say that the neo-Nazis started this thing. They showed up in Charlottesville. Excuse me. They didn't put themselves down as neo-Nazis. You had some very bad people in that group. You also had some very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group -- excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down, of to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.\"\n\nAs such, since there are people who aren't a part of these hateful groups that are also there, they could be referred to as \"fine people\". He VERY CLEARLY defines all aggressive groups there as bad people. Do yourself a favor and read the transcript of what he said instead of ignorantly saying what other uneducated sheep say.\n\nLeftist media always convinently leaves out the context in which things are said, and those who don't care to look up their own info end up being misguided. Then you all repeat each others nonsense like the good sheep you are. So fucking fustrating lmao.\n\nBring facts or stay out of arguments, facts don't care about your feelings. Welcome to reality."
