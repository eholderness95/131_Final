Typical liberal MO, alienate people who don't think like you do (that worked well this past election didn't it? Oh wait...)\n\nWhat's upsetting to some is that he's telling people who were, in part, responsible for his success to fuck off. Personally I'm glad he did this, at least I know to not waste anymore of my money to support his career."
