        "message": "I don't understand why everyone is getting their panties in a bunch. He has a right to say what he wants. If you don't like it don't listen. He has never hidden anything. As for him saying fuck you to people he has that right too. At some point everyone is going to have to pick sides. If what he says shocks you then you never really listened to him. If your not going to buy his album good more for the ones who will. It's just funny that people are upset over him saying what he believes in, but when you have racist white power people spreading some b.s. it's ok because they had a permit. Fuck that"
