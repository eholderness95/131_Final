Now he\u2019s dissing on the president just to bruise the nation under God for which we stand, trying to lose the fans who gave him hands, supporting the ones who kneel than stand and making a mockery of our flag..I used to think you was the greatest rapper ever. Now I\u2019m questioning why I ever bothered? Tell me why, why do you do this? Cause you can? I\u2019m out, fuck you too, your biggest fan, this is Stan.."

He's got more money than most of America and he still drives his H2 Hummer and is selling his mansion for less than what he paid for it.  If he was to lose every single fan it would probably be a blessing for him.  I don't doubt people haven't asked for an autograph while he is taking a shit.  He's also spoke about Bill Clinton, George Bush,Obama, and now Trump.  If I am missing anyone else please feel free to correct me."
