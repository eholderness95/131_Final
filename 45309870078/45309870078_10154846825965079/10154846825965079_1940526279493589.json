If you wanna play numbers, let's look at some real ones: 49.6% of eligible voters didn't even vote this last election- of those that did, Trump took 46.4% while Clinton nabbed 48.5%. With Millenials, it was an even bigger gap; Clinton took 55% of the Millennial vote, 36% Trump. \n\nIf you're playing a numbers game, it's at MOST about 23.2% of those that helped him get famous. In reality, though, it's probably closer to 18% or less, because then you're looking at the demographics of a) whether those that supported him early on even voted, and b) where he rose to fame and what demographics got him there.\n\nI'm sorry you feel abandoned by someone whose music you like(d). To expect anything less, however, shows that you haven't paid much attention to his political pieces coming up.\n\n(Check 'Mosh', and 'Square Dance' for example.)"
