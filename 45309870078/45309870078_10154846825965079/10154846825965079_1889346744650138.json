The fucking idiot needs to stay in rap and not in politics. Ever realize he dogged on bill and Hillary Clinton, and now trump. Maybe those rhymes he spit before being famous have him scared, but don't turn on the political stunt. Shit is completely unnecessary. I am confident in saying at least 75% of his earnings by purchase are white. Probably at least with conservative views. So in essence only hurting himself, but like I said golden girl, you keep Eminem. I'll be fine without him, actually replaced him with grand funk railroad tonight. God bless you."
