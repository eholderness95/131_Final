Do we not live in a free country anymore?? You sound so incredibly ignorant with that statement alone.. \n\nSecondly, how can you not see that it is literally the actions of our president which are dividing us? How can you try and reframe peoples efforts to UNITE as a factor in what's dividing anyone???? And the fact you think people cant have an opinion that doesn't support trump, just because he's our president, is concerning to say the least.. Lay back and take it then, huh? Whatever happens, happens. Just dont speak a word of it........\n\nLook, man.. Donald Trump is failing. Hard. It's more and more evident everyday that he is severely underqualified for this position. \n\nYou can't be outraged and call predominantly black NFL players \"sons of bitches\" for protesting racial injustice and police brutality under the American flag.. And then turn around and say white nationalists, who chant nazi ideologies while marching with fucking swastika flags.. ON AMERICAN SOIL.. \"Fine people.\" You do realize American men died in an effort to iradicate nazi ideologies, right? We had an entire world war about it. But, now people wave that nazi flag in America and our president doesn't so much as bat a fucking eye.. How dare the blacks peacefully protest for equality and a more peaceful nation tho... That's so much more anti American than advocating genocide.... \n\nBelieve it or not, you're what's dividing America.\n\nGet your head out of your ass, swallow your pride, and look at the world around you. Put yourself in someone else's shoes for once. It just might humble you enough to land you on the right side of history.."
