It has to do with the fact that we are supposed to try to come together and unite you are supposed to be an example of our kids and our kids future. All you're doing is creating more hate and more controversy. Thumbs down to Eminem he's a bad example for kids and f our country he's all about creating controversy and Hate"

But the thing is what are we leaving behind for our children. Everybody is fighting over the color of skin People's Choice in sexuality and what not. The fact of the matter is when we die we have no color we have no gender. So all that fighting is over nothing when we can be taking the freedom that we have and enjoying it and making the best of Our Lives while we're still alive and here and spreading love. Instead there's so much hate and it seems to be getting bigger and bigger and no one seems to be looking for a way to try and resolve the matter instead everyone gets offended and wants to be hateful back including our leaders"

And then when it comes to money that seems to be the number one factor in everyone's life all they care about is money and greed the sad part is you don't take none of that with you when you die. And you may survive and you may live extremely comfortable but you definitely are not going to grow by being a greedy hateful discriminating person. It's just really sad"

Eminem is hardly an example for an adult let along a child.  Don't get me wrong I understand your point and in this case, we are each responsible for our own actions and together we make up the world we live in.  I think Eminem is just communicating that Donald Trump (president or not) is just not a very good person and unfortunately Trump's contribution to the world is very distasteful (President or not).  But as our President, he is held to a higher standard and he's not fulfilling it.  Eminem just elaborated on all of the ugliness that Trump has displayed.  Don't take it personally."
