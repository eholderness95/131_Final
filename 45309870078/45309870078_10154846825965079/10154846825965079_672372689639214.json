        "message": "I doubt he added many more fans from what he did tonight... (you have to like rap to begin with. And you were already a fan before or werent)...but I guarantee he lost way way more fans from this little political stunt. You can see all the die hard Trump supporters vowing to never listen to your shit again. I feel like he did this because he wanted to feel relevant again. And you know he's gonna be interviewed for weeks now about it. \n\nI personally thought it sucked. But he's still the #1 rapper in my opinion!"
