He's doing what he should be doing.  Go back and listen to NWA, Chuck D, Flava Flav, Marley Marl, Grandmaster flash etc! Old school, all of their music was political.  You so used to this watered down shit where everyone rhymes with the same word they just said that you don't have a clue! Shut up and go sit in a corner, you on punishment!"
