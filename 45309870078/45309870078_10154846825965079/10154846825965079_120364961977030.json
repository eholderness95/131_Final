        "message": "I'm sure this will be taken down as soon as I post it but here goes, I can appreciate that you have an opinion of our president. Good for you that you have a voice but just how un-American are you? Could you have found a better and more constructive way to help steer this country in the direction you think it should be going or is throwing insults the only thing you know how to do? It is the way you made it as a celebrity but it doesn't have to be the only avenue for you to become an activist. Oh and telling me fuck you because I voted differently than you shows how much of a pansy you really are. Perhaps I voted differently because I grew up in L.A. poor rather than in Detroit and I've seen things you haven't. Maybe my childhood shaped me because of the things I've seen and I voted this way because of other reasons. Perhaps I voted against Hillary because I've lived through enough Clinton BS! Whatever my reason being a bitch publicly is lame and wont bring this country together, but maybe anarchy is what you really want."

I am a big fan of Eminem older stuff. But this was wack. Honestly I didn't vote. Cause I feel any way we go we as Americans are screwed either way we go we habe been sense before i was born. Just my opinion. Every one has one and how u voice it is how people are gonna view u as a person. With what is going on with the NFL and all these other celebs \"DOES IT REALLY AFFECT YOUR DAY TO DAY?\""
