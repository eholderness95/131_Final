It's a shame that people including yourself spread so much hate and we wounder why America has seen so much change that we look more like a 3rd world country with shootings and bombs. Other countries used to look up to the United States but now they look down."

And I don't believe that people with the ability to reach millions of people should promote hate instead promote love, and respect for others. The hate promoting is why America is falling apart"
