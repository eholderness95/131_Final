Yeah eminem could use a teacher to teach him some shit he doesn't know. I am well aware he doesn't need too, but education is always worthy of your time (if you can afford it and you didn't drop out of college like moi). he should be a judge that would be legit or something he'd enjoy doing. maybe the president."
