The problem is people in 2009 didn't know how to react to it because so many new listeners were babies in 2002 so not used to what Eminem was so he switched his style to accomadate to the times. Can't hate him for that. I'll will just always be happy to listen to some new Eminem no matter what it is. I believe his new album is really going to be something special though."
