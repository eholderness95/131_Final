        "message": "I don't know if you'll even read this but I've listened to you since your first lp . I remember seeing the CD case a friend at school had and I wanted it so bad. I'm now 32. A lot of things happened in life since then. Like me finding god. Even with my new beliefs I still find comfort in a few of your more inspirational songs like lose yourself and a few others.I just pray u find peace in God like I did and maybe put out a few songs more like them. You got talent dog no doubt. I know you can do great things if you keep god in mind. Much love"
