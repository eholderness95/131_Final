        "message": "What your song Lose Yourself has done for me <3\n\nThis song has gotten me through Basic Training (turned 35 the second week), I ended with a perfect PT test score of 300....it helped me keep pushing through, when I was ready to end my life on this Earth because I felt all was hopeless, my bad choices in life where going to follow me around FOREVER....I make no apologies to those who don't \"approve\" of his music....he, like me, has risen above it all, and has made POSITIVE change <3 I have more respect and admiration for this man, than I do most people who attend church every Sunday. This song has gotten me through a lot....and it will help motivate me to continue catapulting  forward in my life.....eventually through my businesses, to be able to take kids who were just like him in his younger days, from the underbellies of places like Detroit, Chicago, Compton,  East St. Louis, etc.....to our beautiful National Parks....where they can experience something they may otherwise never see <3"
