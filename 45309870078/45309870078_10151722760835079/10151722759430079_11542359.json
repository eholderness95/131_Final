        "message": "Hello, Marshall. I just want to say how much you've inspired myself, given HOPE to millions thru the vulnerable lyrics that expose who you are, what you've experienced, and how you live life to the fullest without the drugs, alcohol and other addictions!! You are the epitom\u00e9 of HOPE, FAITH, RESPECT HONESTY, and the true meaning of RECOVERY!! Thank-you for being the person you are. Thank-you for being real. Thank-you for your story, your truth, your life and your recovery. As you know; As long as the ties that bind  us together are stronger than those that would tear us apart, all will be well....May the wind be always at your back and the Sun shine bright upon your face...... Melissa H."
