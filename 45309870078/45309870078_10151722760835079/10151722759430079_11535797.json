        "message": "Just wanted to say ever since the very first song I heard of yours I have been a fan... In my opinion your the best artist there is at this point! Your real, you don't hide your anger, your humor, your true emotions... You know how to put things from your past into words, that really hit home for me... I never gave up on your talent, even threw relapse... People talked shit, and I still knew you would come back out with some fire, like always... I can't wait to someday see you perform live... My question I would ask you (I know it is early) is, did you or have you been in touch with your mother since the song Headlights? Just wondering how that is going for you... Your new album is THE BOMB! Love it, keep up the good work! <3 Forever, a TRUE Eminem fan!"
