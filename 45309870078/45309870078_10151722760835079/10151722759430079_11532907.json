        "message": "Slim I truly want to thank you. Your song Headlights hit me on an emotional level. I really do thank you oh so much. I hope everyone takes the time to read this.\n\n\"I know my mum most likely can't see this. I wanna just say, and confess how sorry I am. How much of an ungrateful son i've been. For how I always take what you say with a pinch of salt. I keep forgetting how much you've sacrificed for me. Bringing me up through all the shit you've had to go through. And how i've not even bothered to listen to you at times. You'll always be my favourite woman in my life. Whichever woman comes into my life, my future wife will never be able to compete for the love I have for you. \n\nI've messed up a lot in my life so far. And you've always been there to comfort me through everything. When dad left, you know how messed up I got, the things I did, the things I said to those around me. I became something you never wanted me to become. And i'm truly sorry for that. I hate myself for that. I see how hard you work, how hard you beat yourself up and I respect you so much for that. To me, you'll always be the strongest woman in this world. To deal with an unstable son in myself. I always tell my friends about you, only reason I do that is because you are someone i've always looked up to. The coolest woman I know. You ain't some young woman, but you're young at heart. \n\nAnd that's what makes you who you are. The mother I love, for now, tomorrow, next week, next month, next year and every moment I breathe. I promise you, i'll change. I'll prove to you, that your efforts to bring me up haven't gone to waste. I'll make you proud. Never have I typed a status and teared up. All it took was one song, to make me realise how ungrateful i've been. Thanks mum, for everything. However far imma be from you, I hope you know you'll always be the only person on my mind. Thanks again mum......\""
