The first one is no really bad deal. But the second one sold a lot of vocals from famous artists in fact without proper authorizations for publishing despite the promise. Its 50000 $+ invested the worse thing is the possibility my project to be shelved i paid and got most of these features just ask Cashis about me... The tracklist we made the music for and paid for the vocals :\n\n01- It's Knoc Turn'al (Knoc Turn'al)\n02- California OGs (Bad Azz, Soopafly, Kokane & Butch Cassidy)\n03- OG Party (Daz Dillinger & Kurupt)\n04- Time to die (D-Jukes)    SHELVED\n05- Burning Hot (D-Jukes & Sophia May) SHELVED\n06- Fill the glasses (D-Jukes, Sophia May & Aida) SHELVED\n07- If I were to die (Steve-O & B-Real)\n08- Dumb Idea (Steve-O & D-Jukes)\n09- Take it to the crib remix (Cashis & Bishop Lamont)\n10- Painful Discharge (Steve-O) SHELVED\n11- Flawless (Homeland Security, Cashis & Young De)\n12- U Beautiful (D-Jukes & Sophia May) SHELVED\n13- Yolo (Jack Thriller, Sophia May & D-Jukes) SHELVED\n14- TBA (D-Jukes & Ne-Yo) SHELVED\n15- Close to Mine (Aida)\n16- The Come Up (D-Jukes, Kobe Honeycutt & Lea Sunshine?)
