        "message": "Eminem, first of all I'd like to thank you for putting out another amazing album. I personally have been listening to MMLP2 on repeat since it dropped. \n\nMy question to you: Do you feel like it's easier to write songs like \"Survival\", \"Rap God\" and \"The Monster\" as opposed to \"Legacy\" and \"Stronger Than I Was\" ? \n\nThanks for writing music for everyone, about so many different emotions. You're truly an inspiration!! <3"
