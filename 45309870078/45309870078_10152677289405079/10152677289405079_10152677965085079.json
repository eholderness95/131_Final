        "message": "Been sober 10 years. Started a meth addiction in 2000. Gangs, crime, dealing, skid row. Cleaned up in 2005. Won the lottery in 2008. Couple million. Survived that too. Now I mop floors in the treatment center I went too, Edgewood. Things turned out good. I want to write a book maybe a movie one day. \n8 Mile really helped me out back in the day. Maybe I could help others with my story. Help me with that bro... Thanks in advance."
