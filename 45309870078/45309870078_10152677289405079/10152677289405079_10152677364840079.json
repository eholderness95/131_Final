Eminem is on a completely different level. Nothing even gets near eminems level, Can anyone else name an artist who can make a lullaby about killing his wife, taking his daughter out on a road trip to dump the body, put his daughters vocals on it and play it to his wife. Who else could write a hit number one song on mtv filled with suicide attempts and his English teacher wanting to have sex with him. And still make the words flow and make us all laugh. His lyricsim is off the charts even before he became mainstream. Like these lyrics here \"I got lyrical capability all in me with the agility to escape a killer bee colony\" I know it's not his best but any true lyrical rap fans will get it"
