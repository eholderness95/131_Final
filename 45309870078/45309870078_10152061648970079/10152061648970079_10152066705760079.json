        "message": "Mr. Marshall Bruce Mathers III, I waited over a decade for you to make a song like this. I can now truly close this door in my life. Staying bitter only dries the bones. I use to hate it when you dissed your Mom it made me cringe on the inside. I have a lot of respect for you more than I ever did. I ran out and bought your first cd you ever made, I had all your underground shit before you made it in this dirty ass music industry. I was there in the background the whole time, I hope you get a chance to read this comment. A know your fans care  the world for you, we stuck through the paparazzi when they slandered your name. I dont cry often but this song had me tear the fuck up. Congratulations for doing the right thing, after all the shit you and I went through was almost the same life. Thank you Eminem!!!! Greg From South Carolina!!!"
