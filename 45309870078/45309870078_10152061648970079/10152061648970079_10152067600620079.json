        "message": "The first envelope taken from mailbox has his childhood address but it also has a post mark date of August 8th? 2014 on it. Does this date have some significance? Maybe its just random?  I know it's a tour date for his show in CA but if it's not random I think it would be something of greater importance, not a concert date we already know. \n And btw Em always goes above and beyond but we here in Michigan WILL ALWAYS get the best shows!! Sorry :p \\m/"
