        "message": "WARNING! Carry on reading! Or you will die, even if you only looked at the word \nwarning! Once there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was \nten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her\nmom and her dad. She got so bad she went\nto kill all the staff in the hospital so the More-government decided \nthat best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to \nkill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were \nusing went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she died. \nNow every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that \nreads this letter, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your \nroom and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to \ndeath. Now send this to ten other pictures on this one site, and she \nwill haunt someone else who doesn't. This isn't fake. apparently, if u \ncopy and paste this to ten comments in the next ten minutes u will have \nthe best day of ur life tomorrow. u will either get kissed or asked out,\nif u break this chain u will see a little dead girl in your room \ntonight. in 53 mins someone will say i love you or im sorry"
