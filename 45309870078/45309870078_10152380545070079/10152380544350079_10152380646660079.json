        "message": "Marshall...Mathers...\n\nYou've made it through so much... I've felt similar struggles and had a hard time adjusting to different things. Idk...happy birthday but never forget what happened. LEARN FROM IT, but I did the other part....I let it consume me.... It hurts everyday waking up without the woman you love and knowing u have to go to a dead end job to make ends meet and have your power cut off at times and sit alone in an apartment in the dark you can't afford to rent out anymore because your job cut your pay...your boss is an asshole and everyone you trusted stabs you in the back no matter how many times you trust them. I had a friend who free styled w me and got me into rap a while back and he recently passed away. He had the sickest rhymes I've heard in a while since your First LP. \n\nIdk if you'll read this or if anyone will actually but...I know what it's like to live like a bum....to feel like a failure even in the roughest times stay positive cuz one day...one day....you'll make a difference...anyways...\nHappy birthday Marshall."
