I miss your old music...this new \"music\" isn't even good, so why would you want to make music that's like the rest of those \"artists\" who aren't even smart enough to write their own music? Your old music was different from the rest and your attitude made it all the more unique. Now you've turned into one of those \"artists\", so will the real slim shady please stand back up and be proud to be out of your mind."
