LISTEN TO THE SONG AND IT SAYS THIS stop trying to compair to his first albums bro ha think about it would you still be making the same music you did years ago he's going to rap about what he's going through that's why his first albums were so  fire. He's already said so much in his career what else should he say ? And to all of thos that say he fell off or raps to fast or whatever dude he changed his style so much for his fans to make them happy relapse he used accents so he got rid of that then recovery it was too pop rock and no slim shady so mmlp2 he brings more slim shady style to it and people still complain ? Like people will always hate could you do better in his position I highly doubt it. And even if he was making music like he did with mmlp and eminem show people would still be haters and say oh eminem raps about the same shit he needs to change up his style and get with the times you know it's true people will always hate. Yea eminems music isn't as great as it use to be but don't judge him from one song i like the message behind it and I garentee his new album will have plenty of dope songs and I bet haters will still be jaming out to the shit like the  hypocrites they are ha"

If you don't like eminems shit why are you watching it ? Go listen to some drake or lil yatchy if that's your taste then bro id rather listen to some real hip hop then garbage but if that's not your taste then that's your opinion  but garentee again you will be listening to his new album once it's out"
