I don't want someone speaking for me that isnt being affected by the situation at hand. I'd rather find a credible news source and stick with that. Listening to a celebrity whine about politics is sticking my head farther into the sand and throwing myself farther into the dark. They should all take a lesson from Denzel Washington who refused to talk about anything political during a red carpet interview because he didn't believe it affected him and because he knew since it didn't affect him directly, he wouldn't have the correct information on the situation and didn't want to use his influence to lead people down the wrong road. He's a smart man."
