        "message": "I was just starting high school when Dr. Dre's cronic 2001 dropped, i was an em fan ever since, Its weird to say, but iv kinda grown up with em as hes been growing as a person, and now im the age he was when his career was starting to slow down, and i get it man, its tough to walk away from the only thing you're good at, but i haven't enjoyed a full em album since the eminem show.  And i think its just because people change, it just sucks em had to change into a pussy liberal."
