Explain it to me, because in my mind it did sound judgemental, but not bigoted. And especially not bigoted with racial motivations. People like you use the term and don't realize you effectively weaken the meaning and impact of the term in the long run for the current and coming generations. Dont throw racist around like it has no meaning, otherwise you end up with not just white people, but people in general discrediting the term. Do you understand that is part of the problem? Or do you want to keep flinging around words and dilluting their impact and meaning? Your choice may impact coming generations, so choose wisely."
