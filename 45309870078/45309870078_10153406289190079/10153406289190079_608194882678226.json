        "message": "I was sitting on the floor of my office Friday morning at 4:30 am wrapping gifts for Emily\u2019s birthday; it was the weekend I was heading to Sober Camp in Fairview, and I had anxiety.  I was anxious in general, and I was anxious about making small talk in my car on the way to camp with Lisa who is really still an acquaintance.  I worry too much about what others think of me.\n\nChris came into my office with the gift we had decided to give to Hugh \u2013 our daughter\u2019s brother-in-law \u2013 who Chris would see at a joint birthday party tomorrow for Hugh and our grandson Hudson \u2013 a party I would miss \u2013  a party that was scheduled after I had signed up for Sober Camp.  The gift we decided to give Hugh was pot \u2013 weed.  We only know Hugh through Alyssa, and we only see him 2-3 times a year when Alyssa has social gatherings at her home.  We\u2019ve gotten to know him over the last 8 years or so, and we know he likes to smoke weed especially for his bad back.  As it happens, I have very good weed.  It was Chris\u2019s idea to give Hugh some of my weed, and I said sure.  I packaged up some buds in a Ziploc, wrapped the Ziploc in tissue paper, put the tissue paper in a shirt box with a note that said \u201copen privately\u201d and wrapped that.  Chris thought it was a good present.\n\nHowever, this Friday morning Chris came into my office with the gift he had asked me to prepare last week and returned it to me.  He said, take this back.  \u201cI can\u2019t have this in my car; what was I thinking? I can\u2019t drive to Alyssa\u2019s and then from Alyssa\u2019s to Hugh\u2019s house with Cory in the car with this pot \u2013 what if we get pulled over? I\u2019m sure we will get pulled over.  Who\u2019s going to take the fall for this? Me or Cory? We both have law licenses at risk? You won\u2019t be there \u2013 you have nothing to lose if you take the fall.\u201d\n\nI thought someone hit me.  Actually, someone did hit me.  Chris hit me.  Chris hit me with a big lie.  I started to cry.  He asked me what are you crying for.  Nothing I said, I guess I\u2019m overwhelmed and anxious about the trip. He got mad.  This AA stuff is not good.  No more trips after this one and the one in October.  I don\u2019t like you being away from me.  This is the end of it.  I said nothing.\n\nThese are lies."
