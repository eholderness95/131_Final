        "message": "Eminem, I like how you write a story line in your music that relates to a particular type of youth. It would be awesome, if you could do a rap song for elders in their 80's recognizing they are near the end of life feeling the fear ...but encouraging them and thanking them for their wisdom. I personally enjoy your music, but am not the typical demographic. I think a song for OLD people would be much appreciated."
