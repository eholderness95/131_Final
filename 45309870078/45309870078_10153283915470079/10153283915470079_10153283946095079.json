You wanna go and say that artists Like FUCKING  Em, Biggie And Pac aren't on the same level, I say Be Smart And use your words Kindly cause in the end that shit will bite you.. Although they dont sound the same. There are certain Boundries that you as a fan are only allowed to take, and artists should be respected on a certain level.. I really dont think you can fathom your shit right now..Just because Em is alot of things different then Biggie and Pac you gotta remember that as people we all grow up different. But if your talking talent, Eminem has full capability of exceeding the leveled shit like hate, disrespect and all odds.So take your foot out your  mouth.. Cause you have never accomplished a level of respect as any of the artists that represent Thousands if not Millions of true believers... Your just a fucking chump with broken hopes and shattered dreams...Eminem is no fucking joke, hes been top fucking white boi rapper dude, whatever tha Fuk for years. Let Eminem do his work and shut Your fucking Mouth You Dick Headed Fucking Prick... You attract drama obviously, so I just figured ya might as well hear out a fucking guy, that put the BIG In Bling."
