            "message": "What for? None of those dudes do true hip-hop, they're not anywhere near Em's caliber lyrically & Em would tear all of them to shreds. Personally, I'd like to see him collaborate with Kool G Rap, Scarface, NaS, Method Man, Redman, Onyx, Naughty By Nature, DMX, Ice Cube & other lyricists that are actually the same caliber as him. I know he's already collaborated with G Rap, Meth, Red, Sticky Fingaz & DMX, but it'd be incredible to see what they could all cook up together in 2016. Em should also do a collabo with Kxng Crooked's boys, The Horseshoe Gang & the rest of C.O.B. Those dudes are some of the fiercest spitters I've ever heard in my life. Also I'd love to see Em & Dre finally do another album together that's reminiscent of The Slim Shady LP & The Marshall Mathers LP. Cuz if your a long time fan since 1999 like myself, then The Marshall Mathers LP 2 didn't quite cut it. It didn't have the rawness that SSLP & MMLP had. The Shady Cxpher, a few of the songs on Shady XV & the Bad Meets Evil songs on the Southpaw Soundtrack were mind blowing though. Now that's the 1997-2001 Eminem that I grew up to. All he's gotta do is make a whole album with that kind of rawness & get Dre to produce some songs & he'll have another classic under his belt."
