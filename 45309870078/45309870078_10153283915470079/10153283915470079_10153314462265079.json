        "message": "Hi i was wondering if Simon could read some of my lyrics and offer me help in the right direction. I'm not a musician but believe I have a gift at poetry and lyrics I will forward some of my poems but this is a song I thought of and wrote in an hour and believe I can write songs about anything but don't know the first person to ask so who better than the man who knows. Thanks for reading my work and hope I can be shown the right direction.\n\n                                                      F in lie (life)\nI never asked to breathe this air\nWhen I arrived,you wasn't there\nLiquid life is all your share\nI guess that's all,you had spare\nYou should of gone and grown a pair\n\nYou tried IVF, that's so sad\nTo be the dad,I never had\nSo excuse me,for being mad\nThe result came,it wasn't bad\nGod refused to replace,what you already had\n\n                                               ( Chorus )\n\nI should of been,the apple of your eye\nUntil the day that you die\nBut I was searching,reasons why\nI wasn't included,in your F in lie  ( liFe )\n\nTaunted,teased,abused at school\nHaving a dad,made all them cool\nGave authority,to be cruel\nThey all had a separate rule\nI'm outnumbered,an innocent fool\n\nA second chance,you had one day\nBut first you need,a DNA\nEven that,I was made to pay\nYet again,you got your way\nMum was calm,on judgement day\n\nI'm sorry I,was so much trouble\nHave I just burst,your secret bubble\nThe minute you both,met your double\n\n                          ( chorus )\n\nSill waiting for you,an open door\n3 generations,you was four\nYet again,you chose to ignore\nThat door ain't open anymore\n\nImagine this feeling that I had\nWhen my children,called me dad\nMy proudest moment,but im sad\nIt's a name,you've never had\n\nDon't need that tear,from your eye\nBecause it's so fake,it's also dry\nNow I don't need,your reasons why\nThey was written,in your eyes\n\n                          ( chorus )\n\nSo you can take,your F in lie\nA secret with you, when you die\nI did my best,you didn't try\nYou have no choice,but accept why\nI didn't turn up,or even cry\nWe already said, our last goodbye\nYou were never worth, that F in lie \n\nHope my song was of interest I have many poems I will send if you wish to read them, I had a tough upbringing, with no father to guide and support me through life I never went to school so I'm self educated. I chose a life of drugs as I didn't know any right or wrongs, I had a 15 yr heroin addiction I have now overcome 8 yrs ago. I am now going blind due to a rare disease there is no treatment for. I dnt tell you these things for sympathy. I'm a proud man who lost my way I'm a unique character with the quickest one liners ever, I can read and judge a character within minutes I believe I'm very intelligent regardless of education.i only want my talent to be used and not wasted alongside my life and if I get a better future for myself and family it's all been worth it. So thanks for taking time to listen and read. I hope someone within your company or friends can assist me with my talents.thanks again il look forward to hearing from you. But no problem if I dnt hear"
