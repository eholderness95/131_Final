That manbaby wants to control everything and can't handle loss, rejection or even disrespect. I'm not a Democrat or Republican and I respect both sides. But I can't respect him or anyone that still supports him because its just embarrassing now. Also I never said it was his fault for Puerto Rico! I know they got enough food on the island they just need help distributing it through the whole island. Plus me being transgendered had absolutely no reason for me to hate him, he did that himself by kicking out 15,000 hero's out of the military! Please give me one pro to his presidency, just one."

With ICE padding there number can't trust the immigration part. World leader hell no we are a joke to the rest of the world. Military hell no he just told 15,000 trans service members they are going to get kicked out. Plus reports that they are so desperate for new recruits that they are taking ppl that don't meet previous requirements. Also the republicans control the house and Senate and still can't get there bullshit health care passed. Did I answer all the questions? Lol like I said I not a Republican or Democrat and truthfully all I want from a president (since he is just the face of a country) is don't be racist, bigot or a embarrassment. tRump fails!"
