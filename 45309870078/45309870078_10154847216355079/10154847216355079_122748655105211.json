These people obviously think that their opinions matter more than our own, so much so, that they can brain wash their fans politically....WOW, there's one thing that this election should have taught these pampered celebrities, NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!!  We can make or break you baby.  you've begun to think that because your rich and you make a more than comfortable living that you should dictate how your fans vote, well, I'm the silent majority you spoiled brat, and I will not choose who you want for president because I listened to your music.  you're obviously needing some attention, the world has actually been busy Eminem, ain't nobody got time for your drama"
