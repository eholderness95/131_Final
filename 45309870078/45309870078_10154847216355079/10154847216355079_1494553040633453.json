Pretty immature and brave move when you come from the projects and barely had food on the table daily,yeah that GRATITUDE im talkiin about,trust me,I KNOW the D where he comes from,hes FORGETTING all the things NA has taught his arse! Looks like his 12 steps has just flung out the window and if he wants to go back to the projects brown nosing the thugs,i dont care,let him! He deserves it after this!!!! That douche is in relapse mode man! Thats not the behavior of a \"recovering addict\" at all! And after ALL his fans did,standing by his side in the midst of all his fricking ups & down with dope and etc.,this is what he does now at 44 yrs old? Seriously? Hes lost his mind! Im 43 and THAT is NOT the behavior of a 43 yr old,let alone one recovering! He wants to be a old geriatric thug,thats on him but eventually everyone around him will find it annoying.
