        "message": "All the upset people on this thread calling him a white sell out and a Hollywood elite are cracking me up. Em may be white, but he has always been surrounded with people of color. He grew up in the shitty part of Detroit along side people of many ethnicity's.  He's been riding with the same crew since he was a nobody and he made sure they all came up together. He is respected for having brought his team WITH him instead of getting rich off of black culture and then moving to L.A. and leaving them behind like so many do. He has always been an ally to the black community, so why would anyone not expect him to diss Trump? But according to yal he's another \"out of touch elite,\" who needs to \"stay out of politics?\" Meanwhile, Kid Rock grew up in a mansion with a Tennis Court in the back yard and yet somehow represents poor and middle class whites alike so well yal want him to run for public office? Be honest, people don't want Em talking politics because he understands black reality and speaks on it, not because he is a \"Hollywood elite.\" He's not a sell-out, he's the same dude he's been since day 1."
