But I read a lot of rap lyrics, like I read poetry and I love that a capella rapping style.  Like the beat poets of old.  But yes rappers were story tellers. People got all shocked and the violence and the vulgarity.  They didn\u2019t get that the guy was telling what he was seeing in his life. The urban life. He didn\u2019t make that shit up.  But also I think sometimes that some rappers should start trying to help change those stories. Change society, culture their nation for the better.  I see these white boys out here in the country talking and acting that way, I want to smack their heads together. They even get it. The depth of it.  Of course it\u2019s not all deep and it\u2019s not all art.  Like Dylan, Cash, Young and their fellow artists of rap, essentially they are poets!"
