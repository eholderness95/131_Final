Rap God proved you were the best rapper of ALL TIME but sadly you want to ditch fans that have made you rich because our beliefs are different!?!??? We supported YOU when you were a drug addict and just like that now it's F off! I'm a conservative that appreciated and supported your courage when faced with continual adversity!\nYou have \"the stage\" to unite us yet like many others you're taking the easy road! Thought you were better than that! Heart broken \ud83d\udc94and disappointed! May God Bless this Country \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 and all the hate that divides us\u270c\ud83c\udffd"
