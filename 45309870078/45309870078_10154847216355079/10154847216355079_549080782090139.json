A jab here and there at the president is expected since you've done it throughout your career to multiple presidents and both democrats and republicans have supported you and your art. But when you flat out say fuck you to a majority of your fans that have supported you for almost 20 years, paid for your albums, merchandise and concerts, and have made you so successful you just shot yourself in the foot cheddar bob.  Just remember You \"drew the line in the sand\" not you fans. You just shit on most of us like you did Stan, so \ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udffb you M and your stand. Hope you have a career back up plan."

In a recent song he did \"no favors\" on Big Sean's album he dissed trump and I still bought the record. I respected him as an artist and his right to free speech on whatever subject.  This has nothing to do with trump. If an artist or athlete tells a fan \"fuck you\" that's pretty much it. Not gonna have someone spit in my face and come back for seconds and I'm sure that's how a lot of fans feel about what he put out tonight.  It's not so much the trump diss because that happens daily, it's the flat out lack of respect for a lot of people that have supported him his entire career."

He can't even keep himself in line for his own political party. And everyone said this was going to happen--and you voted for Trump anyways.\n\nClearly you had no respect for Eminem's legacy nor the messages that he has espoused throughout the years then. Therefore, you ain't even a fan to begin with. Just a punk trying to virtue signal on the internet."
