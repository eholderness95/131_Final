But Scott i do appericate that we can be on separate sides of the political party and still be civil towards one another. Lisa, trump is focused now on running this country. Obama had specials on what family dog he wanted or while in office did a survival special with bear grills. Obama seemed more focused on being a celeb them running the country imo. Shaun what i said was true. Look it up. Football has dropped by a few million views and merchandise sells are terrible since the whole lets kneel for the pledge thing. Movie ticket sales have gone down 30 percent in the past year. So it had nothing to do with celebs threating trump. Insulting his wife and kids? You disagree with me , that's fine. But why im a idiot for saying things that have actually prove behind it.?"

B***h I\u2019ll punch Lana Del Rey right in the face twice, like Ray Rice in broad daylight in the plain sight of the elevator surveillance/ \u2019Til her head is banging on the railing, then celebrate with the Ravens,\" he rapped about four minutes into the seven minute long freestyle. The rest of the cypher is sprinkled with Eminem's trademark commentary and insults to popular figures, including Anderson Cooper and his sexuality. Azealia Banks slammed the rapper on Twitter in defense of Lana Del Rey: https://twitter.com/AZEALIABANKS/status/531999407529820160 Lana has yet to comment on the lyrics, but she has praised his work in the past. In an interview, she said, \"Eminem is the master of lyrics, whereas Frank Sinatra is the master of vocals\u2026 I f***ing love Eminem.\" Watch the video of the cypher here.\nKeep Up With PopWrapped On The Web! Yeah,effing hypocrite!"
