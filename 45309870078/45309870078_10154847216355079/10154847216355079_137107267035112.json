He brought us nothing but divisiveness, identity politics, erasing history, lies, corruption, open borders for easy access for terrorists and the list goes on. Not to mention he is undermining our current president on any and everything he does. Which is in fact considered treason by law. I cant stand how our countrymen and women have been played like pawns to destroy the greatest country on Earth just because the Democratic Party lost the election. They lost because the people are tired of the lies, deceit and overall corruption that has been bestowed upon us. The country wanted someone that has not been in this political regime.... Wake up America. Its time to get to work rebuilding our country and heal the wounds from the last 8 years, not pour salt on it..\u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2\ufe0f"
