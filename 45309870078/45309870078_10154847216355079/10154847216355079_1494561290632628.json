Obams also took golf outings and frequent vacations..so did bush..clinton..wait a minute...every president did.  So yeah..come up with something legit to belittle trump about.  And em complained for a fucking decade about everything..so he is exactly like trump.  I cant even tell you how many bars he spit about not getting 5 mics.  Cmon..dont you libtards use the internet for anything more than ignorant postings, streaming or pictures.  Theres this thing called a library.  It has lots of books.  Some of them might even have pictures and areas u can color in.  Perhaps you'll find some pop up books..which are right about at your IQ level.  Maybe then you can read about how to purge your suboxin habits and not drain the economy cuz yur fkn junkies.  U kids are too ez."

Your entire country is filled with arrogance and pretentious pricks who all long to live across the pond.  Your gun regulations are a joke..which is why isis continuously hits you below the belt.  You cant even keep a union together because you dipshits dont understand how true diplomacy works.  Not to mention..you are mediocre at everything but soccer and intel.  Mainly intel since your pussy ass army couldnt fend off a litter of kittens from a bowl of milk so you rely on spies..which you clearly still can't excel at since you are a hotbed for terrorism.  Dont worry bro..the brave soldiers of the US OF A will likely once again bail you out.  You are welcome."

But then again,it must REALLY suck being Em,raised in the projects,not like the rest of us white kids in the burbs who was able to know what it was like to be a kid w/o having to brown nose just to survive going to school and outside to play! This is all about his childhood survival and PTSD ,having no choice but to make the best of what only his mother was willing and able to give. While we went to roller rinks,birthday parties,chuck e cheeses and safe parks & playgrounds or to grandmas house,he was shut in a trailer or roaming around the ghetto sucking butts to survive and the only thing to do was to hang in the hood and learn to live THEIR way. yeah,this wasnt a choice,how does it feel knowing your entire life,your attitude and behavior and your style was all based upon what you only had and could make of it vs what you really preferred,wished you could of had and wanted. Didnt judge you for so many years,but since you went there and decided to judge all of us,those who does support our new potus or decided to give him a chance,since it is what it is, and what we got,you screwed up. What a smack in so many of your fans faces! That supported you during your effed up years. Since you chose to be SO blunt,i decided to be just as Blunt back! Regardless how i was raised in the suburbs,I was still also raised,if one swings first,dont hesitate to swing back! You swung first!"
