        "message": "Marshall Mathers just lost the respect of a big chunk of his fan base. What an infantile display of emotion and abuse of the power of his gift. He is talented and I've always been a fan of his music, but I really am disgusted that he's become a part of the problem. We don't need your personal feelings and opinion to strengthen the divide. Asshole. Use your influence in a positive way like you have in the past."
