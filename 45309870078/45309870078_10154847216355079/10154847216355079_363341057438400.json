Flow was great I loved the slam poetry aspect.  But Eminem, you have no idea what you're talking about.  You're just pissed off and putting extra emphasis on words that tend to make people uneasy with our government.  I thought it was super ballsy for someone who has made hundreds of millions of dollars off fans for decades to draw a line between him and then.  We get it you don't need us.  We'd like to have you back to be honest, but we don't need you.  The difference is, we need Donald Trump to succeed."

You were on your way up to being a shining and respected (mostly) beacon, the main leader of the world.  Now you're the world laughing-stock; that crazy uncle we're trying to hide in the attic and hope nobody remembers we had any relation to.  Trump came into power, y'all took a sharp turn down.\n\nSo yeah.  Have fun with that.  'Cause you and the rest of his nuts are the only ones who think he's doing anything resembling succeeding."

Your ego does not matter to anyone but you, and Trumps and yours will be totally demolished.  Do what the rap artist said, turn away or fuck off.   No one cares."
