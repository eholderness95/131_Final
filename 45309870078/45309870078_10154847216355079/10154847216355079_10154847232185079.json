If you're going to talk big to Michelle, make sure you're citing where you get your information from. In the age of fake news, I believe nothing average racists like you have to say. Matter of fact, whatever sources you cite are probably bull anyway. Trump has only done so much, as his era items aren't all in effect. Whatever numbers you're seeing are usually the remaining down trickle of the previous administration. Which is why Trump is trying to repeal and replace everything. So you sir, are the big mouth. Talking like the keyboard Nazi warrior you are. Anything you say is entertainment, so I appreciate you providing a good night for me. I enjoyed reading your nonsensical jabbering."
