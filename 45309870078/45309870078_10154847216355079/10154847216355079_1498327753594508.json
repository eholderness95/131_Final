        "message": "It's hilarious, everyone on here crying about how dare he say something bad about the president. He's always done that. He's talked shit when he wants to and he speaks his mind. This is no different. Do you really think he cares about losing fans? He doesn't care in the slightest. He's always spoken his mind about whatever he wanted, and people were okay with it up until now. He talked about killing his ex, his mom, went after other celebrities, talked about drugs, said vulgar shit, but oh that was all okay. Talk bad about trump? Gasp how dare he!"
