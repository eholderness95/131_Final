This shut the fuck up, stop rapping and run for office and make a change in this world. I dare you...but you won't. Just like all the others out there bitching and complaining. You hate the way law enforcement is? Then put on a badge and do it yourself go patrol your streets at night. You won't even do that and I'm sure your neighborhood is nice. \n\nYou don't like your politicians, or what they are doing? Then run for office ANY office. You won't and you know it. So if you're just going to sit around and point the finger at those who are at least trying to make a difference, then just do me and everyone else a favor and shut the fuck up and go back to writing rap songs. \n\nI'm sure losing me as a fan is no big deal to you because you have millions. But in terms that you might understand know this, for the rest of your career... I'm taking a knee."

I actually, truly, and unapologetically believe that Trump is a terrible person. Like, not even basic human decency. I would love to have just about anyone else is office that is a republican than him. That being said, I, and Eminem, can criticize all we want of those who hold positions of power. It should be our duty to always check and balance powerful positions because when you\u2019re in one, it\u2019s incredibly easy to abuse your power."

I try to make it a point to not judge anyone before actually knowing them. \n\nI wanted Bernie, but we have Trump and that is our reality for the next 4 years. And just like in the past when I voted for someone who wasn't elected, I still always respected who was elected President of the U.S. and stood behind them. That's what you do when you love this country all of the time and not just some of the time. \n\nAll I'm saying is this, you can either complain about the problems surrounding you or you can do something to change it. Trump might not be even close to being a perfect President but at least he's trying and that's more than I can say for a lot of people. \n\nAnyway, politics are politics much the same with religion, that's why it's a topic best not argued between friends. You have your opinions, which I respect. As I have my own opinions which I would hope you respect. Not everyone sees the world the same and that's okay. \n\nAnyway, hope you are doing better, I can't wait till you are back at work after you kick the crap out of cancer!!!!  If there is one thing I know we can agree on is this... FUCK CANCER!!!\n\nSending love and prayers your way. \ud83d\ude18"

Em has a big platform, a lot of fans, and it makes it easier for him to speak out and be heard then say it is for you and me. Like he said in his freestyle, use their platform to speak out for those who can't. Things are being done to attempt to change (protests). And yes, we don't know Trump personally, but its pretty easy to see what kind of person he is. From how he's acted on shows before, to interviews hes given, words that have come out of his own mouth, his twitter. I'm not one to jump to conclusions about someone either, but I feel like this gives a pretty clear indication of him. Plus, Em has always talked shit about out presidents, and has been very open and speaks his mind about what's he's feeling."
