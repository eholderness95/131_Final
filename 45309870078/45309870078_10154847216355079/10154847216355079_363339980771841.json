I'm a libertarian and supported Rand Paul during the election and a big reason I supported him was because he was the only one calling the injustice out. Rand Paul was constantly talking about how blacks are incarcerated at a way higher rate than whites even though whites commit just as many crimes. He's called for criminal justice reform, ending mandatory minimums, ending the war on drugs and still does to this day. You might have known that if you guys weren't letting the mainstream media and celebrities tell you how to think."
