        "message": "seems like everyone forgot that he dissed Bush and Clinton. It's not the first time he rapped about politics.  He keeps it real.  Always has.  How do you not see what is happening to the country?   He said what everyone is thinking.  Look at all the natural disasters we just had. Our president is putting the NFL on blast when he should be focused on helping people.  I have no choice but to have hope Trump doesn't let our country go to shyt, none of us do.  If everyone stays silent, then we'll end up experiencing another 9/11.  I lost my Aunt and Uncle that day.  I wouldn't wish that on anyone.  Thanks Eminem for speaking the truth.  <3 Hopefully one day I'll  get to meet you.  I named my daughter Hailey, because of you.  I'll always be on the line Em is on."
