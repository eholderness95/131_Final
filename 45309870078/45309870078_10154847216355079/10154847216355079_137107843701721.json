The goal of the globalists is the dismantling of our American heritage & thereby the destruction of our identity as a nation. Removing historical statues is the beginning. Removing the flag & the anthem is next. Ultimately the goal is to remove the constitution. If we keep giving in, continue to accept the dismantling of our culture & the removal of our heritage; then we become what the globalists want...a 3rd world country prime for socialist control. This tactic isn't new. It has been their game plan for a long time. There are many writings explaining this movement. We are seeing it unfold before our eyes. It's deeper than what you see on the surface.\nNo matter how tired you are of listening to the back & forth about the flag & our anthem, you mustn't grow weary. Don't allow yourself to get to the point where you say 'Just stop playing the anthem at sporting events' so we can get back to football. Just letting it go is why we're here in the first place. Stand for the flag...Kneel for God! You want all your rights back? Stand together for God...flag and Country!"

I'm done with Eminem, nothing to do with his views of how our government should be run, but his actions on that. And it says a lot that most of you support Eminem in doing that."
