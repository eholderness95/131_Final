How much of those millions has he put into the public transportation in Detroit? How much of those millions has he lowering energy cost on inner city housing? You know all the things that actually make a difference in the world. Not oh let's take a van full of kids to toys r us and spend thousands. Warwick Dunn showed the world how you make a difference. Buy a single mom a cheap car so she can get to work. Buy a kid a bed instead of f$&king Jordan's. He needs to sit his ass down and shut up. Give Obama props?, yeah for killing Detroit?, that makes perfect sense."

I will say, I was raised to respect our president and I'm not a sheep who believes all I see and hear in the media when it comes to trump. But what Eminem did tonight in no way takes away for what he's done for music, the fans and the public. He's been acknowledged for donating to hospitals , jails, and paying college tuitions and loans. He doesn't like to be credited for it. He's done more than people\nGive him credit for. He's a humble guy. I don't agree with all he said in that cypher and I think athletes, singers, actors should stay out of politics being that they're so out of touch. But em is em. He pushes buttons and that will never change. Let's not forget what he's said in the past about Clinton being an adulterer and rapist, bush being a murderer. It's what he does just can't take it to the head. More with a grain  of salt. I'll always continue to support him and his music, regardless of what he said tonight , he's done so much to bring myself happiness"
