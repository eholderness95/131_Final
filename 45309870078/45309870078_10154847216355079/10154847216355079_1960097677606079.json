        "message": "Y'all are funny with that 'stay out of politics eminem' bs. If you were true fans you would know that he made a whole song bashing Bush in his Encore album. He's also made songs bashing ja rule, *NSYNC, and Fred durst to name a few. This guy is a lyrical genius who sticks up for what he believes in and doesn't give a fuck about what y'all think. Trump is a pos president who is running the country on his own racist money sucking agenda. I am happy to be an Eminem fan 15 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, and definitely right now. Fuck you donald!"

He didn't just sneak in a barb because it flowed. He went after him and told all of his supporters off, and he knows he has a lot of hangers-on who are Trump supporters. This is what it looks like to stand up to racism. He has drawn a line in the sand."
