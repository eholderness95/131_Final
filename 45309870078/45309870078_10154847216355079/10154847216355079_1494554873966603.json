Rapping about how if he were black life would be easier for him in the rap industry. Oh that's right  he told America he was just kidding at the end of the track haha. So that makes it better. He doesn't like how inappropriate and racist Trump has been but it's okay for him to be racist in his music and talk about killing his mom and beating his ex-wife. He's a real super star \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83e\udd14"
