        "message": "No disrespect to any actors out there- but the correct way to hit a speed bag is in the same manner as a straight or a jab, not overhand, or hammerfist, as they usually do in movies. The proper motion trains the boxer to rotate the hand the proper amount, because if you don't rotate the hand correctly, the bag goes spinning, and you have to start over. Nothing wrong with hammerfisting the speed bag- do it all day, if you want- you just aren't doing any good for your technique. Peace."
