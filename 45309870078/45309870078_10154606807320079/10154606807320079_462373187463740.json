I know you are too famous to listen to a Spanish white boys rap he literally is half ads producing on his phone, I don't have money, I don't have a job, I barely have a roof over my head. And I'm tired of being broke. I'm also tired of the shitty mumble rappers making millions off of saying dumb shit. Eminem your music has saved my life on countless occasions. I hope you read this. Catch you on the flip side homie"
