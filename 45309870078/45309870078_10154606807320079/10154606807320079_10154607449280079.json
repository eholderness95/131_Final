        "message": "Fake Korean pastors who started their church without permission from true Presbyterian Church are real goats. My family thinks I'd be a good pastor. Since I'm disobedient man who won't follow the Bible, I will start a church without permission from church authority. Then I will say people who speak Truth are goats. I will harass them on line because I'm such compassionate man. But I will have to face judgment day for leading God's children astray."
