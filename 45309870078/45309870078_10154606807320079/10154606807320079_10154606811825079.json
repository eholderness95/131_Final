You'll see more in details where Eminem made these videos like: Survival, Berzerk, Rap God, Detroit Vs Everybody etc. The places where he made these battles in 1995. the street where he lived in Dresden as well as the scenes of his film 8 Mile .. It is a very interesting video that retraces a little the life of Eminem in Detroit\ud83d\udd35\u26aa\ud83d\udd34\nThank you"
