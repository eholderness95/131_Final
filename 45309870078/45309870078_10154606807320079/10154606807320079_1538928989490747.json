        "message": "Enjoy LA while your in town, the weather is hot but the beaches are amazing! It's so nice to read all the comments about how many lives you changed or saved and didn't know it. I'll \"Olways\" remember how you saved mine and proud to say I took that message to your fans to heart at the Monster Tour at the Rose Bowl. \n\nProud to say all those things I struggled to overcome, I finally have! Thx for the inspiration to truly change myself, a better me, free from the chains of addiction, free from the demons of my past! For what's it's worth, my long awaited publishing dreams are on the horizon working on my MBA to make it a success to help others, I could use your guidance on that one day, maybe God willing, He'll provide a way for that to happen. Never know, we might just cross each other's paths in this life, I'd at least like to shake the hand to the man behind the voice and lyrics that saved my life! God Bless Eminem Olways!"
