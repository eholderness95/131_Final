It reminds me of Skylar's \"Back From the Dead (my favorite song by her)\n\nEntombed lyrics\n\nHeavens Die Lyrics \n\n Dedicated in memoriam\n Aloysius Bertrand (1807-1841)\n (lyrics: H}kansson,\n music: Anderson)\n Death thrust this avalanche\n the gnostic tears have failed\n to recover me from Rimbaud\n resurrected to get laid\n emotionally disqualified\n to kill the liquid sky\n I'm on the path to clandestine (god make heavens die)\n Inaugurations of my love\n sanctify the few\n the accursed will share\n insects crawling over you\n euthanasia can rise\n time told by the sun\n submit to leather menace\n and turning of sands are done\n Bury it in a nameless grave\n Heavens Die !\n\nRead more: Entombed - Heavens Die Lyrics | MetroLyrics"
