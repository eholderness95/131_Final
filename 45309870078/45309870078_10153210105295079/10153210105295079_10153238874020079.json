        "message": "December 26, 2015\n\nNever-Failing Power\n\nPage 376\n\n\"As we learn to trust this Power, we begin to overcome our fear of life.\"\n\nBasic Text, p.25\n\nWe are people accustomed to placing all our eggs in one basket. Many of us had one particular drug of choice that was our favorite. We relied on it to get us through each day and make life bearable. We were faithful to that drug; in fact, we committed ourselves to it without reservation. And then it turned on us. We had been betrayed by the only thing we had ever depended on, and the betrayal left us floundering.\n\nNow that we've stumbled into the rooms of recovery, we may be tempted to rely on another human being to meet our needs. We may expect this from our sponsor, our lover, or our best friend. But dependence on human beings is risky. They fall short of perfection. They may be on vacation, sleeping, or in a bad mood when we need them.\n\nOur dependence must rest on a Power greater than ourselves. No human force can restore our sanity, care for our will and our lives, or be unconditionally available and loving whenever we are in need. We place our trust in the God of our understanding, for only that Power will never fail us. \n\nJust for Today: I will place my trust in a Power greater than myself, for only that Power will never let me down. Eminem have a good day"

The people are already calling them Kings and Queens and love them more then our congressmen! I just do not want them becoming Tyrants its why i attacked there character! I need them to understand that a King and Queen only have 1 Castle and the majority of there wealth is to be used to take care of there people and to construct communities and citys....These stars manage money better then the Government does...they can collect the taxes...Eminem happens to be the smartest one in there bunch! So I would make him KING AS WE MOVE TOWARDS NEW WORLD ORDER! AZGUARD CITYS OF GOLD! HAVE FAITH IN EMINEM AND IN THE STARS THEY CAN DO THIS! START ORGANIZING! I WANT THE ARMY ON OUR SIDE NOT THERE'S!
