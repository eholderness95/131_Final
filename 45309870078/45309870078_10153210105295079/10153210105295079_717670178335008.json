At least we know that we are no longer intentionally making life miserable for people.\"\n\nBasic Text, pp. 39-40\n\nIn our addiction we often treated others badly, sometimes deliberately finding ways to make their lives miserable. In our recovery, we may still have a tendency to pass judgment on others' actions because we think we know how that person should behave. But as we progress in our recovery we often find that, to accept ourselves, we must accept those around us. \n\nIt may be difficult to watch as someone's insanity manifests itself. But if we detach ourselves from the problem, we can start living in the solution. And if we feel affected by another's actions, we can extend the principle of forgiveness.\n\nJust for Today: I will strive to forgive rather than be forgiven. I will try to act in such a way that I feel worthy of self-love Eminem you see this bull shit."
