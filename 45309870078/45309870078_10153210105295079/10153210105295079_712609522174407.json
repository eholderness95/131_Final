        "message": "Three new music styles that just came to my mind are Angel pop music and demon rock music and God music! Those three should be very cool sounding!Also another style of music that just came to me is called goblin rap music, this could sound a lot like Ja rule music or eminem music. Those two also have tremendous talent in the arts. I love helping people come up with new ideas for there music and acting and dancing.I want to hear eminem do a rap cover of Justin Timberlakes strawberry bubblegum.Justin timberlakes 20/20 album flat rocks! Eminems eminem show and recovery albums just flat rock the world! Michaels invincible album just flat rocks the world! Ozzys Down to earth cd just flat rocks the world! Angel pop music should sound like Michael jackson music and Justin timberlake music. God music should sound like the music some people will hear in heaven some day when they die. Demon rock music should like Ozzy Osbourne music or marilyn manson music."
