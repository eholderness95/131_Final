        "message": "This will probably never see the light of day but your music has got me through a lot. At first it was because of my mother. I don't speak to her anymore. She's crazy and that's the first connection I felt. But i am better for it.  Your music got me through a breakup or 2 also. But I just lost my wife. I always liked mockingbird and that song speaks to me. Keep doing what you're doing. You're helping people out. People like me. Keep being real. We need more real people."
