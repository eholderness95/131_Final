Featuring your boy Ernest Lowndes aka LowDown, Jeffery Prototype Buggs, Rob Ronin, and Jake Mugge. Show your support with this track making it on to iTunes and AmazonMp3. ALSO, be on the lookout for my upcoming album here soon called Too Nice 4 Too Long. I'm going to work up to that release by releasing a hit single off of it through the major online music stores such as iTunes and AmazonMp3 every month. This one is for this month, obviously! Again show your love and support and download this beast of a track! This one will be on Replay for a long time!"
