King (1983), 10 \n\nOhio App. 3d 93 -- Headnote 1: \"A partner who is authorized by the partnership to transfer title to partnership property cannot be held criminally liable for theft of that property, even assuming he \n\nembezzled the proceeds or the transferee did not pay for the property.\" (Case involved used cars.) Their devotion to creating change started them down the path of what New Era Windows is today.\n\n(d) Any open video system that complies with 4774 U.S.C.A. 573993 ; \n WATCH BGF IN A COP WATCH AND WATCH RANDY JACKSON FOR A VOTE INVOLVING MEN AND WOMEN SIGNING THE ARTICLES FOR #SELCTIVESERVICES\n#http://www.bing.com/videos/search\u2026\n\nWATCH BGF IN A COP WATCH AND WATCH RANDY JACKSON FOR A VOTE INVOLVING MEN AND WOMEN SIGNING THE ARTICLES FOR #SELCTIVESERVICES\n\n State v.
