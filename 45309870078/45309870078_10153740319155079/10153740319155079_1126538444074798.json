        "message": "Em don't need to make more albums, I'm sure he will though! The difference between Eminem and these other rappers is that he stayed true to himself! He's still wearing $10 hoodies! He never changed up! He's taking care of family business, not letting others do it for him! He's raising a daughter instead of a \"nanny\" raising her like most famous people! He's trying to get his ex wife help, not dropping her like most would! Much respect to Em! Drake is no comparison to Eminem!"
