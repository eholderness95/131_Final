Just wondered though could you possibly use your chance to be heard by millions to help us move forward? The shit is inching ever closer to the fan these days, we have insane amounts of global issues that threaten everyone's ability to be on this planet. The banking cartels are still buying everyone's lives from under them and selling us back their twisted and perverse perception of reality. Since 2011 our oceons have and still are being contaminated with nuclear waste. Rigged elections, false flag attacks, continuous genocide left right and centre all over spherical hell and you guys are having a soap opera over who can say words better?! Who's the best rapper? Who gives a shit when the entire world around you is falling apart. Actions speak louder than words and it's time we all stopped acting like this dance will never end! #JustSayin \n+"
