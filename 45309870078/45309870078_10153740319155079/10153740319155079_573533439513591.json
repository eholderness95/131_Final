Both have there own kind of music and both I listen to, but drake is more relatable than Eminem."

Like Oskar Paradise Virolainen said we don't relate literally but some can. Drake gaps about the same things most of all the others rap about sex girls and money. Drake is nothing special. His music shouldn't even be considered rap. At least Eminem can write his own music."

Since it's such a common talent \ud83d\ude02 Drake is a entertainer. His job is to make as much fame, fans, and money before his time is over. Yall are too worried about drake and Eminem. Both of these guys are on there own wave and doing legend shit. You don't have to like drake but each and every town he goes to for this summer 16 tour, is sold out. He's doing something right. Even Eminem thinks so."
