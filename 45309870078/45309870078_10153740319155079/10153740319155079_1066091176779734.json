        "message": "Em didn't go soft, he's just tired of this rap game bullshit where rappers hate on one another just for publicity stunts. Then someone takes it too far and shoots (or gets shot by) someone.\n\nRap was never about this hate, and Em realized it. Toy Soldiers explained pretty well how he feels about this \"rap game\". Y'all homies need to calm your tits and stop promoting this hate. This destroys rap, this destroys the  people who like rap, this creates stupid petty rivalries between people who could actually be friends and work together. think about it!"
