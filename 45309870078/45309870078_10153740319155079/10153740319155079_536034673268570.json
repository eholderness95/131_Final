        "message": "It doesn't matter how much $ one makes,because it all comes down to financial management,most of the time seeking more pay either has you spend more on unnecessary things or receive more debt on expensive things that carries long long payments just to get clear, knowing that no job is guaranteed to last forever and the more that you get in debt the more likely you'll be working for someone's dreams for a long time.\nYou'll be surprised how a humble heart can stay working at a minimum paying job for someone else and also have side businesses all their own knowing how to manage & run their business without being there themselves because they don't don't have a trust issue and as they create more small businesses here and there giving opportunities for other people to take care of their family ,they just sit back and watch the blessings pile up ,most minimum wage workers that are smart or even people that get a good salary don't have to stress about paying  more debt than what they actually make.Don't work hard,work smart,sometimes more $ can come with more responsibilities which stress can also follow which will eventually lead to paying most of your $$ to hospital bills,thinking your $$$ will be left behind to the family,but maybe you'll pass down the medical debts or other payments to your loved ones after you get laid down to rest.-S.Orfila"
