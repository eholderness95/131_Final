        "message": "Fuck that Em. Murder his ass the way real rappers used to, ain't like he is gonna start any real beef afterwards. No one will get shot and you'll put this tv star wanna be rapper who cant write his own lines in his place. Your fans, the ones who know what you're capable of, we wanna see you roast his ass like the old Em would. You got dozens of albums worth of material with this fucked up country of ours, where is the fire we know you got buried? You have hands down some of the best anti-politics rap ever made, and people got blind after you stopped pointing it out. The People need you Marshall, this is an S.O.S."
