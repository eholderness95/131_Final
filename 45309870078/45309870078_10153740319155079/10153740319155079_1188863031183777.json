        "message": "Both artists rap about bad relationships, ones bad relationships are relatable break ups with girls, the others bad relationships are with his entire family, and everyone he's ever known, except his daughter. \n\nOne talks about murdering people pointlessly, and hating his own mother, the other is getting Rihanna, do I sense jealousy here.\n\nAnyone who's a fan of Eminem, essentially, supports crazy white people, I mean imagine if Eminem didn't have rap music to vent his problems? He probably would have shot up a school by now."
