        "message": "Eminem... I have listened to his music all my life and I have had one of his songs for most moments in my life. I have never wanted to met someone more in my life than I would if I have ever had a chance to met him. He has worked hard to prove himself in a world that doesn't have many white people that do it, and he might have fucked up a time or two but he is the greatest rapper to me! I'm not wanting a response from this or anything from the man, but I am truly happy listening to his music and having him do what he does. I am 27 now and I don't know what I would have done not having his music growing up! Thank you sir for doing what u do!"
