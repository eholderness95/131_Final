        "message": "Eminem is the man who brought hip hop to every single corner of the world. An artist, in the word's definition's truest form. His flame made him mainstream even here in Portugal, and his talent made it impossible not to be his fan over the years, making a lot of us non english natives improve our knowledge and making the world a more friendly place. I'm 32 now and a fan since I was 15 - 17 years flew by. Thanks for putting yourself out there, Mr. Mathers, you're THE man. (Not Stan, just a fan ;P)"
