None of it was true, if they did battle it would be only out of fun. Eminem respects Drake and even said himself that hip hop needs him. I may not like Drake and alot of people don't but if their was beef Eminem would never had said those things and even done a photo with him. Honestly I think Eminem's beef days are long gone. He has nothing more to prove and is still in his prime. He may not be in the top 20 hits anymore but he's actually better now than he ever was. Just because he's not dropping club hits doesn't make him garbage which is what people are thinking now a days, He's just legit rapping now. That's what everyone wanted from him. And he's doing just that. Staying involved in the rap scene and keeping it alive."
