        "message": "Yeah I'm extremely disappointed in the fact that Eminem didn't utterly destroy drake. Not even for a challenge or for the lime light or fame. Simply for the fact that drake has a huge head for somebody that can't freestyle, and somebody that doesn't even write his own shit. Money and sales and how many bitches you get shouldn't be the only thing that matters in hip hop. The message you send is what should matter. When I was growing up, people were ridiculed if somebody wrote their raps for them. What kind of shit is that? Biggie was a legend, tupac was a legend, Eminem is a living legend. Those ARTISTS put their hearts and souls into every aspect of their music. Drake is a glorified, narcissistic, parrot. Eminem should destroy drake out of mere principle. JUST to show this materialistic, shallow, spoiled, flakey generation what a REAL rapper is. Where'd you go, em!? What happened to the dude that destroyed everyone and everything just for shits and giggles? And even when it WAS for shits and giggles, it STILL made sense and it STILL had a message. That's the em I grew up on. I'm not even a \"Stan\" type of dude, but Eminem was one of the most influential artists of my teenage years. Lmao i had no shame in being a crazy white boy, I was proud of it!"
