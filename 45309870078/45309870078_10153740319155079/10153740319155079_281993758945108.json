I was parked on Steve Yzerman Dr and you were at the light.\nI was taking a picture of the people mover above and looked over and there were those eyes any girl could only dream of looking back at. Your light turned green, and you were gone.\nMy daughter texted me 20 minutes later to tell me you were there...I already knew. You had a white t-shirt on and your eye was looking between your left index finger and middle. \nI ask for one date if your available. Soon..before I learn you've been married....I have to know I tried."
