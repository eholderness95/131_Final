Eminem subliminally disses Wayne in all of em. \"So why the fuck would i join em when I beat em\" basically firing back at Wayne because prior to \"No Love\" Wayne  was talking alot of smack saying Eminem was afraid to do a track with him because he'd get shown up... there's a shit ton more verses from the 3 tracks I listed where if you look at the lyrics, it may be hard to see at first but after a little research its clear cut he subliminally dissed Wayne along with Kanye and Drake.\n\nWhy those 3 never said anything? Idk but my guess is either they were afraid to, didn't want a beef over an Eminem diss because its well known when Eminem disses someone its basically a sign you've made it, OR the final guess is they just don't know... sorry for the lengthy comment btw lol I love talking Eminem with people especially other fans"
