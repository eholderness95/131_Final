        "message": "Em, I have listened to your music since you started it.  I love your new song.  I am glad you are with this old lady whom often wants to give up because of back pain.  Thank you for holding out your hand to me in your new song.  I needed that.  I will play and post it over and over.  It is your best song to date, I think.  I love you even though I do not know you.  You remind me of my sons.\nPeace,\ncandy"
