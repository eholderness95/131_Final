I've been a die hard fan since I was a little tot and would listen to you with my dad. \"My dad's gone crazy\" was mine and his song and he passed away when I was 12 so I'm getting lyrics from that song tattooed on me. It was funny seeing people who only knew the words to your new song while I was rapping all of the old ones aswell as new along with you. Love you man, always have, always will."
