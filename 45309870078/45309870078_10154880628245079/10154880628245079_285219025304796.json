        "message": "Flint, MI is 68 miles from Detroit. The two guys pictured above could finance the entire restructure of the infrastructure that has deteriorated and left the town without drinkable water. I don't believe they are obligated to fix the problem, however if Eminem is going to come out, diss half or more of his fans, and spew unoriginal nonsense and not do a damn thing to help the city, state he has love for than that speaks volumes. If you truly think Eminem has any issue with Trump you're foolish. This was simply a stunt to garner attention for his upcoming album release. Half the population is so easily manipulated, simply coming out and dissing the president will sell records, and they don't even realize it was all for the money to begin with! I applaud the business of it all. I laugh at the sheep blindly following along."
