I guess you could call everyone, including yourself, a sheep in that regard. Eminem is entitled to his opinion, as are you and all the others that are pissed. But he will not hurt as far as his livelihood. Plus, he really doesn't owe anyone anything. Be a fan or don't be a fan. We live with our own choices and frankly I believe Eminem fully understood he would lose a lot of Trump supporters. I just don't think he cared. Like it or not."

He gained fans because of his talent and the fact that he connected with people through his music. That changes over time and his fan base may change with it, obviously. He's apparently chosen to let his fans know that he doesn't respect Trump supporters. I'm thinking since he doesn't respect them, he also doesn't owe them anything either."
