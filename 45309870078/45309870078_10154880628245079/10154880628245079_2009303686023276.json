        "message": "I see the young kids don't understand why what Eminem did is so just wtf? 20 years ago he was ripping on bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. Go Google that. Now he is siding with them? He speaks on things that are their fault like Trump did it. Obama bombed the shit out of everywhere. Go ask around. They fund the organizations that they say they hate. ISIS TALIBAN. research it. Eminem has too. So that is why I don't get his freestyle. Like he was put up to it. And it wasn't even good. He has ripped harder on nothing than he did on Trump. He didn't make it being politically correct but thinks he needs to have politically correct one now? Earning brownie points for money. Sellout."
