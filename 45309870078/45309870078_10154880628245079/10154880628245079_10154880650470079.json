Do you even know what Trump stands for? He's anti-establishment, anti-demo/republican. Eminem is just another fool running with the main-stream narrative of him being a racist or a vividly bad person, which couldn't be less true, just to make himself relevant again.. Educate yourselves. I know Em has never liked the guy, but if you're that against someone like that, you should really read legitimate facts rather than emotion based opinions."
