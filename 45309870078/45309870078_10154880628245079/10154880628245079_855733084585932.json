They really should all look in a mirror. \n\nTo your point, it\u2019s exactly why this is even being talked about. \nIt\u2019s not Em\u2019s first time calling out a president. It\u2019s not even what everyone is mad about. For him to, draw a line in the sand is just foolish on all levels. \n\nIt\u2019s exactly that, you\u2019ve got fans from years deep in with this guy. All his controversy, never lost his fan support. He\u2019s losing them now bc he\u2019s telling all his fans if you don\u2019t basically vote the same way he does than go F* yourself? \nNobody has to apologize to anyone for turning him off for that alone, everyone\u2019s individual opinion DOES matter. \nEnd of the day, you had to vote one way or another, for a lot of people. Red and Blue sway more ballots than candidates in most elections to begin with. \n\nIt\u2019s just sad bc 1, he\u2019s above this. Have an opinion, but this left winged nonsense is played out by all these other celebs (who\u2019s careers are now ending coincidently), you\u2019re above them Marshall. \n2. This cypher? That trash was the only time in my entire life I just questioned, \u201cdid Eminem just fall off?\u201d\nand this is the same guy \u261d\ud83c\udffb who put Fack on his greatest hits CD, still no hesitation of his lyrical genius. \nThe bars are weak as shit. Nothing about any of that hot garbage says this is the Rap God. I would have believed it more if they said his ghost writer was some corporate democrat. And again, personally. I don\u2019t care if people don\u2019t like the President. You have a right to that opinion, so does Em. But this is so weak Trump hasn\u2019t even responded himself, and he gets in social media arguments on the reg. \n3. We all know your album drops in a month. \nYou\u2019re the only artist of all time to ever go diamond? Double diamond/platinum? (Whatever the technical title is). TWICE. \nYou don\u2019t need some played out political stunt to sell records. Put out your notorious level of music you\u2019ll print money regardless. Your fan base supports you. Dropping this, doing it at the BET awards, announcing then your new signees to your label, then sliding in your album drop...\nThat\u2019s rookie shit, Em. If this is the new way he has to sell records, maybe he truly doesn\u2019t have it anymore and is trying to reach a new fan base. \nWe all have to live in this shit every day, the fans want to hear some dope slim shady original material. Not more political propaganda. We can get that anywhere else. \n\n\u2018Til I collapse, I\u2019m spilling these raps as long as you feelin them. \nTil the day that I drop, you\u2019ll never say that I\u2019m not killing them. \nCause when I am not, then I\u2019ma stop penning them. \nAnd then I am not hip hop and I\u2019m just not Eminem.\u2019 \n\nWords from the rap god himself. His next album is going to reveal a lot of answers to that previous verse."

Regardless of how I feel now, it won\u2019t change my views of him as a rapper, he\u2019s been the \ud83d\udc10 for me for some time now, all he can do now is lessen my opinion of him as strictly a fan. \nBut all these cyphers have been preludes to nothing. Nothing but trying to sell his new guys through his name to his fans. \nI was let down by Dre, even allowing 1% of me to believe the rumors that HE was actually putting out the CD, \u2018Compton\u2019. Bought it anyway for support of course, hoping I\u2019d at least get a couple new tracks from him. Without going into detail, what a gimmick to make extra \ud83d\udcb0 off the Movie. \nShady XV? Same thing. He promoted that thing like it was going to be the next album at first. Eventually it\u2019s a collaboration. Then he\u2019s got 2-3 tracks, more of his classics (like we don\u2019t have all those), and then all his new artists the rest of the album. \nAll this cypher did was make me question his own thoughts, \n\n\u201cMarshall what happened that you\nCan't stop with these pills, and you've falling off with your skills\nAnd your own fans are laughing at you\nIt become a problem you're too pussy to tackle\nGet up, be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled\u201d\n\nActually Slim, no. Your true fans were never laughing at you. We support you. No matter what he\u2019s going through. Why he\u2019s still selling out arenas in his 40s. (Same people you\u2019re telling to go F themselves.)\nRelapse wasn\u2019t even a bad CD, it\u2019s just wasn\u2019t the Eminem Show. \n\nThis played out political propaganda cypher is the only thing that\u2019s got a high volume of your fans questioning you.
