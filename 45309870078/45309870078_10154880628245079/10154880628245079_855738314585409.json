Nobody was talking shit when he was dissing Hillary and bill. Every American has a right to free speech. I won\u2019t be one of the voices that try to silence him. I did feel kinda dissed when he said fuck all trump supporters tho but that\u2019s his opinion. I\u2019m also a huge rittz fan and his new album he dissed trump and his supporters but I still bought his album. Americans need to come together I\u2019m sick of theirs left right bs I just came back last Thursday from 14 months in Saudi Arabia and I can tell u no place is as good as America. Ill still be bobbing my head to em. If u can\u2019t look passed your political views you will never enjoy life. Hell im as republican as it gets but if I stopped enjoying every entertainer that hated trump I wouldn\u2019t be able to turn on my tv. Get it together America"

And either believe his beliefs or fuck off. He literally told his fans to fuck off if they support their President. That's the epitome of \"Its us vs them\". But apparently It's okay for Em to be a hypocrite and bash President Trump for saying \"grab em by the pussy\" but in the very same rap says \"Bitches even cum when I rape them\". Yep so much better. I can see how glorifying raping a woman is a lot better than saying you like to grab them by the pussy. Lmao"

Also, look at all the money he just saved the U.S by taking government funding away from the NFL. Somewhere in the ballpark of a BILLION dollars. And he just abolished Obamacare and will be implementing a new actual affordable healthcare system, not one that claims affordable but has monthly premiums of nearly $1,000. He has also created millions of jobs where there weren't any previously by bringing companies in to smaller cities, or renegotiating to have companies that were planning to leave, stay. He's done quite a bit, but you haters refuse to see it because you're stubborn. You know if you admit he's done good, it admits to being wrong about him. It's okay tho, we know what he's done good. And he's done more good in his first couple of months than Obama did in two years!"
