Lol, people are just made cuz the 44 year old granny rapper made a fool out of himself by looking like a teenager throwing a tantrum cuz they mad at thier parents.  All the classic signs were in tbe video, tellin daddy \"i hate you\", jumpin up and down like a fool, giving the bird, drawing a line in the sand( lol...seriously though), talkin in an annoying whinny voice, forgettin what to say, runnin around in circles, childish insults(the laughable your orange line)... i could go on forever! I wonder if he got sent to his room?"

Or that i used three periods in a row. Or that the exclamation point after \"forever\" really isn't necessary. Or that i typed \"made\" when i really meant \"mad\", or when i typed \"tbe\" when i meant \"the\". Why didn't you use your grammar nazi skills to point any of these out?  I bet you were like \"Haha, i got him. He he used the wrong spelling of you're...busted!\"  Bravo my friend, bravo!  You can't see but i am standing and clapping."
