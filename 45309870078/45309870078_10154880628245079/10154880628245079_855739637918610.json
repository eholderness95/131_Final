He's always challenged the media in so many different ways.  \"I am whatever you say I am\" ring a bell?  \n\nYou think he's one thing and he flips it. Which is why he was so popular in the early 2000's. \n\nSo yeah, when he takes things that people say and twists/leaves things out, then tells his fans(who like me have not always agreed with but were still huge fans) that if we don't believe like him, F- you?  Yeah, no, that don't work for me regardless if I support Trump or not. And it's sad to see others just agree with it."
