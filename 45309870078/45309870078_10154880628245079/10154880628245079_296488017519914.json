        "message": "Stick to rapp god, you know nothing about politics. You can take a punk out of the ghetto, but you cant take the ghetto out of the punk. You hide behind a mic and security, rapp usually draws attention to the ghetto life, most people want out,you promote it and sell it to people of differant skin color who are the main ones that want out, then make fun of someone for their skin color, i listened to you when I was young, then your lyrics sounded like the enquirer and I realized, im grown the fuck up, haven't listened to you since, go ahead and make records, i won't but them"
