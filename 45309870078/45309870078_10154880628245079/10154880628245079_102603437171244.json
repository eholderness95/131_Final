        "message": "Still love you. But telling your fans \"Fuck You\" ain't cool. Hate on Trump all you want, rap about him, diss him in freestyles, whatever. It's your freedom of speech. But as a Trump supporter and fan of yours for almost 20 years, that's low, even for you. Your fans have stuck by you through thick and thin, a lot of them being Trump supporters. I still love you and your music though. Just disappointed that you'd shit on your fans like that."
