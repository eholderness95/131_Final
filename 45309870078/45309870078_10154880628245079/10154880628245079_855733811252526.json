No doubt he's a great artist with what he has produced, but he is mostly just following the masses at this point. Hate me if you want, but up until the BET awards, he was in the shadows but like everyone else, he came out to make himself relevant again. For marketing for his new album coming out or just finally expressing his true thoughts about trump, you never know what you are going to get."
