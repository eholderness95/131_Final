Cause I dont see, amongst the millions of celebs who push that snake oil, actually, use it.. When have you ever seen Eminem in a Carhartt? Please, now he's wearing some tight ass jeans and a leather jacket, looks like he got fucked by mcjagger and had a hard time gettin out his closet... That \"beard\" is just depressing... Better yet, are you going to wear a carhartt in Texas?! Fuck outta here with that noise, but I guess people buy stupid shit... Im deciding what to use for a noose wanna help? I was thinking of twine, but that'd probably break, but an extension cord wouldnt... Infact it would be the best thang.. I could plug it on in, and attach Christmas lights, and hang like an angel, Merry Christmas...\r:l Good Night l:"
