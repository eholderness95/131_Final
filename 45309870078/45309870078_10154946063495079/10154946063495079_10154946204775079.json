Because we're intelligent human being who can easily see that Trump is the worst President in American history. People keep using this liberal excuse, why not just tell the truth and admit you're a racist piece of shit? That's what Eminem called the Dotard on. Racism. So getting angry at him for that just shows that you're a blatant racist. Typical bigoted Cheeto lover"
