I don't have to pick a team, I can like whatever I want. I didn't vote for Trump, I didn't vote for anyone. But no matter who won, I would hope the leader of our country could trust that our nation would want him to succeed, because his success is our success. You remember how you felt when you wrote \"criminal\"? You have any idea how amplified and multiplied those voices are for Trump? You think you had haters and critics? Not like trump. But your career succeeded, all the way to Hall of Fame success. Why want him to fail? Look yo, we like Eminem because he is the best lyricist to walk the Earth, let people appreciate the talents you have without asking them to share your opinions. Da Vinci did great things, but he didn't turn around and counteract his art with divisional comments."
