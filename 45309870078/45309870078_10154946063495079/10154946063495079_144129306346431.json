        "message": "Hey Marshall (excuse me, am tipsy right now on Beer, but its the weekend, and am allowed)..Lets me say this then-that you are the few, maybe the ONLY rapper who people from this side of the world love..why? because you are anti-Trump establishment. Your rap songs address issues that concern racism, gun control among myriad things. You have the lot of us who stand firm by you, only because we know you speak the truth, and that you care. Your songs says likewise, so thank you.Lets move forward to a world that has less divisions and more tolerance..Most..Thank you for your generosity..We love you Sir.."
