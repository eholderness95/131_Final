        "message": "I'm certain it was you I made straight eye contact with at the light outside the Joe about 20 minutes before my daughter texted me from inside that you were there.\nI was parked on Steve Yzerman Dr.\nTaking pictures of the people mover from my car, ass on the console, head out the sunroof, son passed out in the back, waiting for my daughter, I finally caught the Big shot I was hoping for (people mover)\nChortled to myself with excitement,  \nI turned my head and caught your eyes.\nAt the light.... Parked right next to me....right fckng next to me and my opportunity fell flat on it's face because the light turned green and you were gone.\nI hope we cross paths again someday or \nThis message finds you and you remember me (and surprise, here I am and yes,I do) or we bump into eachother again with just a few more seconds of eye contact and your intuition might just kick you hard enough to give me that one shot to meet my soulmate.\n-angie"
