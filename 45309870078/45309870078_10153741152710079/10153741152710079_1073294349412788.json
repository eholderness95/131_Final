        "message": "Drake makes ok songs about his bird not getting enough packets of crisps. He's got no context of perspective - spend sometime with Lil wayne and make up a fucked up album made by 2 talented artists that have both lost their way at certain times. Can't be arsed listening to a song about how smooth and silky a dildo that's been stuck up Obamas arse smells like - which is all that's going to happen if you pair grab a mic"
