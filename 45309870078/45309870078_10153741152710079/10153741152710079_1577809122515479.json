        "message": "When I was about 12, i was visiting with my sister and My niece who was a newborn at the time. We went for ice cream earlier in the night, then went home to go watch movies. I had the worst upset stomach of my life, I ran to the bathroom only to find someone was already in there showering , I don't know why I didn't just run outside. So with no time to think I ran into my nieces room, closed the door, grabbed one of her little diapers and attempted to shit in it. Only the diaper was so small it just went everywhere! On the floor, the crib, the blankets, everything! Standing there with shit all over me, my sister walks in and had the most disgusted look on her face and told me to get the hell in the shower. \nShe'll never let me live that one down"
