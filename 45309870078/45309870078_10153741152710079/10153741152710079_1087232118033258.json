That was out of respect, I'm sure Eminem, or anybody would bow if 2pac all of a sudden came back.  Would you bow to fire fighters? Paramedics? People who are actual heroes? What if they saved your children or wife or mom? You bet your ass you'd bow down. Eminem is a hero to Drake, it's all about perspective."
