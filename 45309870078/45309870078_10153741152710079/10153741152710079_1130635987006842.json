        "message": "I have no problem with people liking drake as i like some of his stuff as well and all do respect too him. What annoys me is when people ONLY know drake and then think that they know hip hop. For example i've met countless hiphop heads who know every drake song/album but haven't even heard of Nas Illmatic, any gangstarr song or album or couldnt name a biggie smalls song to save their life. Idk i guess its me, i get annoyed when people only listen to new school because the golden era of rap was so much better than whats out now"
