You are and will always be my favorite rapper and the best rapper. Growing up in a mentally abusive family you were the only way I could escape. I knew if you were able to bring yourself up, I could do the same. I'm no where near where I want to be, but I have a few years under my belt now. Don't ever stop doing what you love, please."
