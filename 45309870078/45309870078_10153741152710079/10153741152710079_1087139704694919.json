        "message": "And I don't care if you are the most talented rapper alive- there is no longer any substance in your songs- they don't identify with people or give people hope anymore. They don't make people feel understood anymore. The only good you ever saw in me is the substance I push- that substance is faith. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Charity beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things endureth all things- charity never fails- though you have the tongues of men and of angels , if you don't have charity (love for each individual person as God's child: created to know God and live life full of His Holy Spirit) if you can't see the potential for any possiblity in Skylar and every person ever created- you have nothing - remember D-12 world \"A human life is precious\" Each human is a unique treasure waiting to be unearthed."
