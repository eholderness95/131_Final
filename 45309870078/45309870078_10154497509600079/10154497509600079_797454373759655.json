        "message": "I don't really know how else to get this message to you, but I want to know your advice about me going back to a high-school reunion. I was bullied horribly. I was stabbed with a pencil, kicked, spit on, tormented for my weight and me deformity, and the girls would tell me they liked me just to laugh about it behind my back. To top it off I was sexually assaulted many times. One of the times I reported it I was given the exact punishment as the kid that felt me up. I will never forget the administrator looking me right in the eye, and without any care whatsoever, told me, \"Every year has a kid everybody picks on and you're that kid.\" I also went through child abuse that I don't want to go into detail about here. I know you went through horrible things as well. That is why I want your advice."
