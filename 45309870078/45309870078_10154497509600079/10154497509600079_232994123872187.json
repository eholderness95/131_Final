        "message": "You lost Proof. It's hard enough finding a best friend. It's even harder losing one. Someone that you can just be yourself around, without retaliations. Someone you can let your guard down around. I have that NOWHERE, and I've been all the way to the throne room of heaven. I'm praying for you, if it matters. But, if it counts, don't feel so bad for your mistakes. I literally left a crown in heaven..I fought to get it off. I had no idea where I was, what to do (I actually asked what do I do here...why am I here)? I asked what would you like me to do? I was taught bad things on earth, that traversed up there when I was a toddler. I was just beginning to learn to speak...someone taught me to say g..dd..mmit, among other things. So, God judged me not worthy for his kingdom. Beings were very judgmental, IN THE WRONG WAY. I was lead astray IN HEAVEN. So, I left my crown. Pray for me, if God listens. I have repented...sometimes I've cried myself to sleep. Then I come to earth to face a lot of bullies. I don't understand what happens when you're taught wrong. I had no place, and I looked for one, and I was led astray IN HEAVEN. And I wouldn't know WHO. Do you know how HUGE the KINGDOM of heaven is? I used to hide under a covering cherubs throne. I had a few angels....I was little enough to curl on their laps. Wings were put on me, and this one knight would pet my wings. That's the only time I felt safe...and happy. I left a crown. I either got no direction or too much direction. God things his kingdom is so perfect. I naively want to think that. They don't forgive up there. I don't want to hear about a mistake 40 times in a row. I broke down crying to the archangel Raphael, and I don't even know if he heard me. Just bull shit happened. I felt picked on, and singled out. A man with real lycanthropy took my head off, and I took pity on him and I wonder how he is and I'm not cut out for God's kingdom. It's not perfect up there...it's not."
