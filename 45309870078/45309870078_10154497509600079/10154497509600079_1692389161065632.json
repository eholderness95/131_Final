        "message": "Eminem you have millions of fans but I wish I knew if it makes any difference? They buy your albums and listen to your music, like the artist you are, but behind the art you do do you ever feel fulfilled? Its an art form. I know. And you are awesome, I agree. But I just wonder if all the rapers and breaking-down since the rise of street music, is there gonna be a revelation towards healing? I mean, that is what all this is about right? The beats are awesome the lyrics are harsh..I hope for sweetness in them"
