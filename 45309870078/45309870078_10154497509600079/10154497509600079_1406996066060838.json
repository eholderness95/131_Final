        "message": "Dear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,\nThis'll be the last package I ever send your ass\nIt's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?\nI know you got my last two letters;\nI wrote the addresses on 'em perfect\nSo this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it\nI'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway\nHey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?\nYou know the song by Phil Collins \"In the Air Tonight\"\nAbout that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning\nBut didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?\nThat's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning\nNow it's too late. I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy\nAnd all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call\nI hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall\nI love you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it\nYou ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it\nAnd when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it\nI hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me\nSee, Slim,\u2014shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!\nHey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,\nBut I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up. See, I ain't like you\n'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too\nWell, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now\nOh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?"
