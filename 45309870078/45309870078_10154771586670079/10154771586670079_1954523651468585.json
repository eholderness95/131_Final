My sister and I blew his mind one day in the car when your song came on the radio.(Lose Yourself).. you see, we used to sing it as teenagers, each having our own verses, we \"rapped\" the whole thing and he fell in love! The whole moment was incredible, he is 9 years old. I told him I would tell you.... :) hope this counts."
