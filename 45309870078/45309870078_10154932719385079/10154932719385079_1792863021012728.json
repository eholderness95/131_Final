My opinion about Trump is backed up by facts, I just took the time to find them as opposed to those who still think he\u2019s just the greatest thing ever. He speaks about, and treats women like subhumans, and you practically worship him. Where is your dignity? Look up all his court cases, current and prior. All the lawsuits he\u2019s slimed his way out of. He\u2019s a conman, always has been, and he isn\u2019t ever going to change."
