        "message": "I'm getting annoyed reading some fake fans saying :\" I miss the old Eminem \" ..\nBitch you don't know shiit about his music I'm sure you became a fan just after the Rihanna song \ud83d\ude21\nAnd when a month ago he was with pink as the old slim shady people start criticizing his age and he should grow up and not constantly talking about killing his girlfriend .. \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 \n  People understand what you want .. if he talks about womzn he is too violant or aboit politics its not his place ... well at leasr hes real and he got the balls to say the truth to the whole wolrd ..If you're a real Stan a really Eminem lover you know that Marshall is more about lyrics and emotions . And he has created the slim shady just for his crazy side .. . \nSo when you listen to Eminem's song you need to feel it not hear it .."
