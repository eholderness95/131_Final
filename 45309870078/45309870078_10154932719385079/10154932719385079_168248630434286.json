        "message": "I'm not really into Beyonc\u00e9. Her voice doesn't really do it for me. I'm not really attracted to her. She's pretty and talented but I ain't into her sassy diva attitude unless it's portraying Foxy Cleopatra and musical mega stardom hardly suits her. She's just a mediocre pop/R&B singer. But she dwarfs lady Gaga & Katy perry in all aspects. I guess for a female artist she's pretty successful and I'm okay with other people liking her music. Me personally I don't care for her music unless she's collaborating with Jay-Z and I think they make a good couple happy for them both every king needs a queen. She seems like she'd be a likable person in real life but she got this Jenny from the block persona. I think it's weird Eminem chose her for his first single which is like a commercial pop move. Not really a step in the direction of an old school Eminem type production."
