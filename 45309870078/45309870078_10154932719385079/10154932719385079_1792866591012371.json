And just to note, the world and many of your fans will always care and give a fuck about your rhymes and you will always be relevant, never will be out of mind you're always on every one of my playlists, 'let us down' I speak on behalf of many when I say we worry about letting you down just as much, and just wanted to say that we (your fans) all wish you all the best!"
