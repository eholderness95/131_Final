        "message": "I remember a time when Eminem ran around with a chainsaw on stage wearing a Jason mask collaborating on tracks with Xzibit, Dr Dre and Snoop. Now he dresses like he's in a boy band and collaborates with Pink, Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9. Eminem lost his way many years ago and now his music is the ever disappointing, horrendous and appalling sorry state it is today."
