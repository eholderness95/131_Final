You know what Eminem the people are off your lawn now you can actually grow some fresh grass and plants to breathe oxygen again.  When doors close it doesn't mean you failed.  It happens for a reason and is a blessing In disguise. Trust me.. Don't believe the lie that to be worthy everyone has to like you.  There are slot of lost and negative people out there.  It's bot your responsibility to make them happy it's their own responsibility. But you can help so many in need in big or small ways who will genuinely appreciate you for being a real person..the Bible says to always give in. Secret and never let your left hand see what your right hand is giving.  Because our creator sees all that is in secret.  The people who give righteously and them want to be known and applauded they have already received their reward which is the applaud but when giving in secret Tue Lord stores up your rewards and treasures in heaven.  I believe this because it produces fruit of Love and where there is love you cant fault nor steer wrong.  That's why I am a believer because I see the results and produce of believing is positive. You can't fault positive can you."
