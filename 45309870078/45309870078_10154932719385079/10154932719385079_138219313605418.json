        "message": "I cried. I'm a Huge fan. I don't think I've ever heard such a raw emotional rap from him. He's at a whole different level now. He's trying to get  everyone to understand he's just like us human no different then anyone. He makes mistakes and is a perfectionist and is hard on himself. Everyone he's some ass because of the he kills his rap all the time and act like he's heartless. This is a great song of whole new level! I've been dying for as a EMINEM fan for him to come back as Slim Shady and the fact that at the end of the song he said \"I made Stan\" this album going to sky rocket and be one of the greatest.\n#LoveEMINEM #Walk On Water #REVIVAL"
