        "message": "Wow! Called the haters out. Reminds me of 8 mile where he says all the disses before you can. Absolutely correct and I\ufe0f think he\u2019s right about having to listen to the negativity on the internet. It\u2019s out of control and everyone thinks their opinions are solid.\n\nIf you\u2019re here to just bash his music, your life is pretty aimless. Go do the things you love and listen to the artists you like. If you keep visiting an artist you don\u2019t, it\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re so negative\n\nRealest rhymes he\u2019s ever made:\n\u201cEvery CD critics gave it a 3 then three\nYears later they go back and re-rate it\nThen called The Slim Shady LP the greatest\nThe Marshall Mathers was a classic\nThe Eminem Show was fantastic\nBut Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it\nI guess enough time just ain't passed yet\nA couple more years, that shit'll be Illmatic.\u201d\n\nLook at recovery! 300 week\u2019s on the top billboard after everyone complained! The expectations are so high that we devalue his work because we expected better. Just let him change as an artist and enjoy the old music if you can\u2019t enjoy his new work."
