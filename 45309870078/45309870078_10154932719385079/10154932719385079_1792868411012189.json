        "message": "Eminem is usually pretty open when it comes to letting his fans into his life thru his music. But this song is so personal so deep arguably his best work absolutely beautiful, although i don\u2019t care for anything Beyonc\u00e9 does she is ok on this. This is not my favorite track by him but this is a great track nonetheless still one of his best songs ever. \n#GOAT"
