        "message": "Eminem, fearing his irrelevance and failure with his pathetic unwanted \"comeback,\" needed Beyonce to bail him out.  I'm sure he had to give her 100% of the profits for her saving his \"song?\"  And likely 50% of the profits for the entire album, which will still make him more than if he went solo and sold the 100 copies he would have sold without her.  This will likely be the last POS he will come out with before he gets caught for some crime that sends him to prison for life."
