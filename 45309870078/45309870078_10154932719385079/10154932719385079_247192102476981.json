        "message": "It\u2019s funny, a lot of people are saying that Eminem is no longer relevant and that he\u2019s not as good as he was back then and that he sucks and all that shit, are just proving Eminem\u2019s point that he made in this song. He knows that he set the bar high with his early work and that he might never reach that level of hype again. I applaud him for him releasing this song because he\u2019s showing that he\u2019s only human and that he know he won\u2019t meet everyone\u2019s expectations. The new music that he\u2019s releasing is for the fans and those who just love music in general."
