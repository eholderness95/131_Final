        "message": "This track would be shit to those who only listen to trap raps like Kodak Black, Migos, and the likes.\nI feel it sounds more mature and like a \"dusk of me\" kinda tune. Just some piano sounds, a simple Beyonc\u00e9 chorus,  \"meek and humble \" lyrics by Em, and not much of the catchy beat of this age.\nIt's just another dimension of Shady. A very lovely track tbh\ud83d\udd25"
