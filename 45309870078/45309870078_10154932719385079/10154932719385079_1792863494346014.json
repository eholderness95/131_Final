I mean shit just listen to the Marshall Mathers LP. See the problem here is most people started listening to Eminem after recovery, but regardless this dood been telling his fans to fuck off for years. AND he's been saying things against what he feels is corrupt government for years to, people act like it's a new thing. \"Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents, I'd rather see the presidents dead\" Eminem said that himself over 10 years ago. Plus with songs like Mosh White America etc. he was against corruption or what he felt was corruption and he still is against that. Not much has changed for Em and anybody who's\nListened to his whole discography would know that"
