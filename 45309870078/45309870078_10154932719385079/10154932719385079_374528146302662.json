        "message": "Probably the only song where we hear Marshall bruce Mathers and not Slim Shady or Eminem. He has made more emotional and personal songs before of course but I feel that this is the first time I am hearing the man behind Eminem, behind Slim shady. Everyone who's saying that this song is shit, try to listen to the lyrics of a song one time in your life, helps understanding it."
