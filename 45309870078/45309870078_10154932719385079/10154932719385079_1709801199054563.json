        "message": "I can see why Eminem wrote this song. Because a lot of you expect too much. You guys have expectations that are too high and that shit can really put pressure on someone especially someone in the music industry. It ain't easy. For example, the people that are saying \"Oh Eminem needs to go back to his old style.\" Dude shut the fuck up alright? You gotta understand and get through your thick skull the fact that it's never gonna happen. The old Eminem was struggling with life and he's on drugs and now that he's evolved from those things, you guys call him weak? I see that as a strong motherfucker. I could never say that I want him to go back to the old him. The dude almost died from drugs but it seems that some people forget. I honestly understand where Em is coming from on Walk On Water. Y'all need to chill with the expectations such as \"Ohh it better be good.\" Or \"oh it better be like this album or that album.\" Just chill and give new shit a chance for once."
