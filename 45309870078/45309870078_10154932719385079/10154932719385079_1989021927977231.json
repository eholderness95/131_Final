        "message": "Dear Eminem - I just wondered why you had to use the word retarded in your new song with Beyonce? After your awesome anti-Trump rant/rap I was disheartened to hear you diss people with intellectual disabilities just like DJT did during the campaign. I am hopeful you would offer an apology and make an effort hang out with children who are mentally delayed for a few hours to see how wonderful they are. Sincerely- Sarah, the mom to an awesome 10 year old with Down syndrome who doesn't deserve for society to mock him"
