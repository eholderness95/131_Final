        "message": "i am literally wiping my tears right now this was so powerful first of all we all know that he can rap circles around just about anyone on this planet but the nuance is in the ability to be able to paint such an abstract master piece and then to pick the brush up and with the final strokes adding such a deep and introspective message into a song that takes you on a roller coaster of emotions and plays like a movie for me the focal point was just the raw amount of passion the questions and answers you rustle with in your head while listening  do you love rap not s much as eminem do you appreciate artistry not as much as eminem  have you given blood sweat and tears to this craft not as much as eminem  it makes you question everything but at the same time you can do nothing root for him it is no wonder why he is the g.o.a.t. alot of people say it but very few show it RAP IS EMIN\u018eM!"
