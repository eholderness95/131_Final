        "message": "The song is not my favorite, don\u2019t get me wrong the song is good.  It has a good story behind it and the chorus is beautiful.  Beyonce has a beautiful voice.  But I\ufe0f was hoping for a little bit more smoother rhyme scheme and at least a beat.  I\ufe0f still bought the song, I\ufe0f never miss any new Eminem music but I\ufe0f hope the rest of his album is a lot better."
