Coz hip hop has has great effect on it and has completely demolished the racist meaning of the word. It is now used for a friend.\nEven my friends use it among ourselves. \nAnd thanks to the likes of Em, Beastie Boys, Big Pun, and other white rappers who made hip hop famous is the white race, it is now loved by all the races, even whites.\nThere ain't no thing like race, we all are humans."
