First row standing in PIT, we bought him a 50 cent cap and you took it off his head & spun it around. You then put it back on his head.\ud83d\ude0a it's now behind glass doors & nobody can touch it.

I try to explain what I know about he understands more then ppl give him credit for it help him tho he is a talented young man. He is hgt so its a way to deal I guess ... Music has no age limit its understanding it that complicates things ..I think you are awesome parents ppl are so shallow now days family time is family time that's more than I can say for most at least your interested in your kids life and interest my son may be 9 but if you conversated with him he wld blow your mind away ... They are unique individuals I wld never want to take who and what my sons interests away unless they are harmful I love his individuality his principle is also on board with educating him on rap and how it started and how lyrics are poems my son is very gifted n tends to get bored in school n in trouble so I feel ya on that but whatever you can do to better your child as long as its appropriate then you are great parents dnt let losers that dnt have time for their kids tell you diff .."
