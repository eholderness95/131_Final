        "message": "Hey what's up Slim? My name is Davey Muddiman and I'm an inspiring artist! Been putting in work and recording my songs in the studio! I want to get signed so bad! I have a 3 year old daughter and I want to be able to give her anything and everything she wants and needs! My baby moms left me cuz she felt like I wasn't ever gonna be shit and I want to prove her wrong so bad! If anyone can relate I know you can! You probably get letters and comments like this all the time but I'd rather try and fail then not try at all and even if I don't hear back from you I'm still gonna keep killing shit and I will get signed and they will call me shady jr not just cuz we have similar backgrounds but because I'm a lyrical mastermind just like you! Hope we can make some cash together if not I'll see you when I get there! Stay keeping it \ud83d\udcaf check out my music on IG:doshus_music link to my sound cloud is in my bio! I'll be uploading new music! Don't pay no mind to Ganja. Did that for shits and giggles! I hope I hear back from you soon!"
