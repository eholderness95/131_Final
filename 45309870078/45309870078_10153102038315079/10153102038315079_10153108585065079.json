        "message": "Ahemed sebbato.you know your Quran.i respect you for your believe.your right to say Jesus is not god.he never claimed to be god.if he was god almighty as some believe.why would he say I've come to do the will of my father.& go into the wilderness to pray for strength for what he was about to go through.surely if he was god he wouldn't have to pray for strength.would he ?. Also when Jesus saw that people wanted to worship him.he said to give thanks to his father who is in heaven.you believe that Jesus is not god son.then that is were I disagree with you.because I believe Jesus offered up himself as a ransom sacrifice for our sins.so that we can be forgiven.also gods commandment.is thy shall not kill.so why don't those who believe in that commandment do ?."
