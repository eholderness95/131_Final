        "message": "Ridiculous and soulless as usually. But millions of children with barbaric tastes will be happy. This musician is only discredits himself. For now he has one of the worst flows that I've ever heard. Even regular stand-up  comedians can sound better. Comparing to this Weird Al Yankovic is the God of emceeing. Poor, pitiful Em, with such tasteless image he looks like complete loser than a hero. In popular culture he takes his place right next to the heroes of Twilight movie. His songs are meaningless, pretentious and phony as his phonogram at the concerts. Actually, he will look great beside confused and extremely lost girl named Bella Swan. I think she is perfect female alter-ego of Eminem. Both are awkward, faceless, lifeless, terrified, panicked. This video is loud, big-budget capture of the degradation of one person and his helpless music. It's a shame."
