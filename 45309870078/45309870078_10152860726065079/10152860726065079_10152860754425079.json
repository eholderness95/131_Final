Just because he's not on pills rapping about drugs doesn't mean he's gone downhill. The dude sobered up and is trying to be a lethal as he can be with his skills. The speed, grammatical structure and riddling in his latest music shows that."

The last album that Eminem released was MMLP2 in 2013. \n People are saying \"How did Eminem go from selling 700,000 copies of an album in a week to only 130,000?\" They don't realize that it's because it isn't an Eminem album. \nIs Eminem on most of the songs? Yes, but it's still not his album. \nShady XV was released for 2 reasons: \n1. To celebrate 15 years of Shady Records,\n2. To promote the artists signed to Shady. \nThat's it. A lot of the album was also just old cuts that didn't make it to any other projects (like Yelawolf's \"down\".) \n  It's honestly more like a mixtape than an album. \n  I think the earliest we can expect a new Eminem album is 2016. \n( I just wanted to point it out to the people that didn't know.)"
