It is because Marshall Mathers and Kim Matters were disadvantaged youth and I am strategizing using my situation to help people in their situation and my situation... if someone understands my situation they may care enough to take a diplomatic look at these things and  look for solutions for today's youth and future youth and disadvantaged people in general..  this isn't the only person I try to work with... but probably the only one who has a complete understanding of this situation."
