He used his music as an outlet, venting everything he has gone through, both in childhood and adulthood. People evolve, either in a good way or bad way. He uses his music now to inspire and to show others they can succeed and they too are freakin Phenomenal. He's a fucking genius. I'd like to see how you'd lay your life on the line, for millions to dissect. How would you spin it?"
