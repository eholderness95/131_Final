        "message": "A lot of people riding on his nuts(as expected). I love his new flow, but this song is awful. The chorus is sub par, annoying and seems to lack a \"phenomenal\" feel. I found myself feeling tortured as I worked my way through the chorus to hear his verses, I mean cmon this is what listeners are gonna hear the most why does it have to be annoying? His first verse was trash, the last two were good. The beat sucked also but hopefully that movie won't.\n\nHis \"Rap God\" flow however worked well on...\n\n\"Vagas\"\n\"Speedom\"\n\"Best Friend\"\n\"Detroit Vs Everybody \"\n\"Psychopathic Killer\""
