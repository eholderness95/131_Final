When your at the top there is always going to people trying to bring you down and it shows right here in these comments. He's open to a lot more critic nowadays for becoming who he is. Tell me whats so astounding in the rap game that someone else is doing that he isn't. Drugs, money, sex and disses. Same message different styles. Quit being so analytical like everyone single one of you invented music just enjoy it and if you don't like it say so but don't diss someone else for their taste. Sorry for the rant."
