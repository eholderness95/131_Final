        "message": "Absolutely phenomenal  set. 2nd time I've seen you live and it did not disappoint. Milton Keynes 2003 was the best gig I've ever been too until last night. Seeing you in my home country was awesome. Loved every song. Can't wait to see you again someday. The band were fantastic and the support acts were awesome too. #lyricalgenius \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\u270c\u270c"
