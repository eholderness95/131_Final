        "message": "Grew up listening to this album and \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" as well as \"The Eminem Show\" even though I was only 9 years old when this album dropped in 1999.... Probably shouldn't have been listening to the explicit version at the time, but I was going through my own personal hell and his music expressed a lot of the same pent up feelings I had towards a number of people.... Your music was my way out so for that I thank you! Keep turning out those hits Em!!!"
