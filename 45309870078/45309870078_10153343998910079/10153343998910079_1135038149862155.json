        "message": "Eminem; Marshall Mathers III\n\nPlease do more than one concert a year, even if it is only in Detroit, MI. I am a fan not for all the music you put out that is twisted, or messed up, but for the music you put out that has meaning. I listen to you for songs like Beautiful, Not Afraid, Lose Yourself, Like Toy Soldiers, and so on. \n\nPlease come back to the music world, I miss the greatest rapper alive. \n\nPeople come to see you. If you make an appearance at a show for someone else, the show is no longer theirs it is yours. People love you and miss you. \n\nI'd even go to a concert I did not like anyone at, just because I knew you would make a 2/3 song appearance. \n\nSincerely, \n    A Long Time Fan. \n\n#Eminem #MarshallMathersIII #ComeBackEminem #EminemLive #Please"
