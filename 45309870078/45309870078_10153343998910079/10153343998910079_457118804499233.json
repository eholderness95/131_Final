        "message": "I was 12, yes 12 when I bought this album off one of those CD catalogs I got from the mail. It was a promotional deal, get 5 CD'S for a penny and you were then subscribed to a monthly thing. Lol I never paid it but I got my CD! And Slim Shady LP was the 1st one I picked out. I was super sheltered before that, wasn't allowed to buy my own albums and only listened to Mexican music in the house prior to that.\n\nMan, were my eyes opened! My mind blown! Slim, you will forever have a little piece of my heart. I can't believe my parents never knew I got this CD. Lol Brain Damage!"
