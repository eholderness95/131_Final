Nobody is clever just for rhyming words, stray from the fake kids, pride is naked and it typically takes witts, digging through shit and having your life reversed. Take this gift and be a misfit first. It's not about competition nor a plot of fiction, i was born to make a lot of friction and a great decision to be a lyrical piston with no subdivision or par, unmet and unknown, strange to the bone, free you of your hands like no phones in the car.\nI'll laugh, having your stomach turn twice like butterflies out your jar."
