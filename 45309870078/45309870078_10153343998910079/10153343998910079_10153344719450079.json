        "message": "I remember one day i was recording a hip hop radio show where i live off my stereo, and i happened ta catch this song on it. I went ta listen ta tha tape on day and heard this song. I must have listened ta this song 10 times, in a row. I was jus in awe at tha lyricism in tha song. After that for 2 months i had ta listen ta that song at least twice a day. I neva kne his name then and that whole time i was thinkin he was black. Months later i heard My name is on tha radio and they said its by Eminem by this time i seen tha video i kne Em was white. And tha station was playin back 2 back sets and after it they played i dont give a fk. I couldnt believe that Em made that song, that i was hooked on for months religiously. And from then still Em is one of my top artists and that very song is one of my favorite songs. Thanks Em (whew damn my fingers sore now)"
