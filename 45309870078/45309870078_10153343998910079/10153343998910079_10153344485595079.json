Backstabbers and 313 are slowly becoming my favorites, but Dre bringin you up into the spotlight made you Infinite.  Till I collapse, i still don't give a fuck!  Eminem is, was and always will be the best lyricist the rap game ever saw because he chose to talk about controversy. You are a Role Model to me, maybe not the best for some youth, but speaking to the masses is hard when you have kids prescribed meth as Adhd medication makes it hard to look good.  Clowning on the daily problems of America in your music made you great to me.  I will always listen to your music, even if people don't approve.  I take everything you say in your music as a joke, and it makes me laugh the more I listen to it.  Much love, brotha.  I wish you and your family the best and congrats on your success.  It will be a sad day when you leave music for good."
