So we expose our kids to all genres of music. U wanna say something about punk rock, metal, classical, or any thing else??? Im raising my children to b open minded and not judge. Maybe adults can learn frim that too."

Children r exposed to so much now that its up to their parents to educate them, and i have. Music is inspirational for all ages. And violence and cursing r everywhere, listening to eminem is the least of it. I guess they thought they were talking to an uneducated person."
