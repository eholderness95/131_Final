        "message": "I remember I was like 10 or 11 years old when I heard \"hi my name is\" come on the radio before I went to sleep for school. And it's been nothing but love since. And when Eminem Show came out my mom bought it for me cause I needed I.D. just to get it. Even got to see you and 50 in Detroit in 2003 or something. They were nosebleed seats and the bass drowned out everything but I didn't care. They're memories I get to share with my mom. So thank you, MUCH LOVE"
