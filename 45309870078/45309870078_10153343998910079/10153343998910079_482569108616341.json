        "message": "The first I heard of Eminem was in 2009, right around the time he released the album \"Relapse.\" This is when I developed a love for rap. I don't much care for his Shady persona, but as Marshall, his tracks are relatable and inspirational. Yes, even a Christian like me understands the beauty this art is capable of producing!"
