        "message": "Dear Heavenly Father we come before you and petition for the courage and strength to be the difference that makes a difference in the lives of our youth. May we dilligently strive to make a good thing happen in their lives. It may be a tiny as just a smile. But a hug would be better. Lord may I extend a helping hand to one of them at least one of them that causes hope and by that spark if hope may faith ignite and magnify itself in their hearts. Most important keep me alert standing on guard...READY because I'm listening and paying attention to you...because by helping another I'm truly only helping me. That I may help you as you have called me to love each other. Amen! AND AMEN!!!"
