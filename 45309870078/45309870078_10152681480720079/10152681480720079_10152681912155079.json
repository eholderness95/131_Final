        "message": "Here's the only advice I can give you M. This is YOUR work! YOUR pains and struggles! YOUR life scribbled out in lyrics! No matter how much any of us fans hate or love ya, NO one can walk YOUR road. So for any of us to try to illustrate what these albums mean to us would only do them an injustice to the person who walked them out step by step! I wouldn't care if you put a photo of every type of shoe you wore during each album on the cover tracing your steps back. We'd all still buy it! Plan an simple buddy, you took all of those steps yourself. We just watched! So this is YOUR moment once again to show all of us a part of YOU. Design away brother! Make YOUR mark once again! Save the $ or give it to charity!"
