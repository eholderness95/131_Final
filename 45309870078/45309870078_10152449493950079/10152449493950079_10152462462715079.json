        "message": "Honestly, all of your songs are fantastic; but this one.. I can't put into words how much I appreciate that you wrote, rapped and published this song. You really give everyone an insight into the music business. The lyrics \"But I rather make \u201cNot Afraid 2\u201d  Than make another motherfucking \u201cWe Made You\u201d really touched my, and probably millions others, hearts. Also, interesting to note, while your angry songs are masterpieces... the ones you made before them hit my heart the most personally, while you're looked upon and respects for dissing others, I respect you the most for your songs filled with love; personally they played the biggest influence and remain my favourite since I was a little girl. Felt I had to say it"
