        "message": "You probably get hundreds, maybe thousands of these a day but I promise to you this one is different. I'll make it short and sweet. Gage Garmo, a kid who's gone through cancer FIVE TIMES and has maybe a week or 2 left in him wants to meet you. It's been his dream for who know how long...He's been through so much in his life time yet he's only 17. I can't begin to explain how strong this kid his. He's from your hometown too. Detroit. If you can't find it in yourself to at least come grant this kid his one and only last wish, it would mean the world to us, his friends, family, and everyone he's impacted, if you could at least donate some money to him and his family at  http://www.gofundme.com/garmostrong . I have a feeling you know what it's like to know you're losing someone close to you. How painful it is. How you try to do anything to make his last few days the best he's ever had. That's why we just want this for him. Please. #getgagegarmotomeeteminem"
