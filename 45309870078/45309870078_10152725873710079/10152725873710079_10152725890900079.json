The impressive thing about RG is he is coherent at talking about the same thing (Him being great) through the whole song at an great speed. But tech on his best day doesn't beat Eminem. Never has & never will. And I heavily fux with Tech. He is a great one and if the industry wasn't punks people would recognize it. But he still ain't better that Em."
