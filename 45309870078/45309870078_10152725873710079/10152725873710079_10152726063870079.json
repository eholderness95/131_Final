Eminem is literally a RAP GOD he's inspried me to move forward in life and he's been there whenever I'm feeling depressed, angry, or just all together happy as fuck. Marshal is a genius and anyone who argues otherwise is the oppisite. I love Em he's my idol and I am thankful for him. \nI wish I could see him live before he retires..."
