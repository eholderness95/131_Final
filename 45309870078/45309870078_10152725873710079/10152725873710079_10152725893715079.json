Pac was famous for FIVE years, accomplished all that in 25 years nd a few months on this earth. Ems 40+ now. Pac didnt put out ridiculous bs music either. Ems very talented, no doubt bout it, but pacs music had way more heart and soul, everyones different but I have never seen anyone who listens to a wide spectrum of music say em was better. Only fan boys and little kids who only know 5 tupac songs."
