        "message": "Dear Yogesr Ary n, you forgot about Dre... fucking simpleton who prays to be saved but hasn't got a clue on how to be brave but for a nam...you pay, pay and pay! Fans made him this way digging a shallow grave for all the things he had to say but not today because all we get is a fucking game to play! How has things change, when more people are enslaved, slain or thrown away since Slim Shady jumped on stage? Be that, what it may but devil's in the detail and Eminem is a slave just the same, a sellout to his name and that's okay but it's only himself he saves, not us because he stays, you crave and pray? I feel betrayed in the delay of every word he gave; when he overdosed on fame and tried to stop being a dad to Hailie Jade! Like I said You forgot about Dre! Now fuck you and have a nice day!"

            "message": "Well she has legitimate points which if not given a perspective to look at through the eyes of a preacher she would one day act like what Stan did in the song Stan. You must not as well say anything offensive if you understand what it means to be Eminem's fan. She is no bully to me or anybody nor can anyone as it would never be something to ponder.  The first time we say about changing something be it house or attitude we first look at the current self to determine for worse or good. When telling others we must check ourselves because we are no one to judge. :)"
