        "message": "I never was interested in meeting anyone famous or a celebrity of any sort. So what, they can act..never seemed special to me. But Eminem is the only celebrity I'd ever want to meet one day. He actually has pure talent. I listen to his songs almost every single day. Not just as inspiration, but because I've never heard anything like him or anyone rap like him. But I'm not going to beg for a new album either. He will do what he wants regardless of me begging for one and I bet that's the last thing he wants to her aside from people asking if he is retiring. If anyone reads this that doesn't listen to Eminem, you should. He truly is the Rap God"
