        "message": "I have a truck new lyrics for you, but I want to make the choice of the lyrics calmly before sending you, because within the music I understood one thing, we have to be almost perfect, you know, there are days when I want to drop all this shit, but remember what you said, then keep writing I pray for God to give me strength and that his sentence comes to my head and I fuck I just know how to do it I just pay for music if I fail that shit I'm doing in the world, so I raise my head and I continue to write, and send you ideas But I also know you have your ideas, I'm just a stand if you lose some inspiration you can use the letters I sent, make them classics because I know that in their hands they become classics Marshall, I fulfill that promise, because the best thing a person can have besides money is the people's trust and s'ose achievement that fulfilling what promises"
