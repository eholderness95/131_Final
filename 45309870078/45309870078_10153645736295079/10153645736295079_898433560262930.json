        "message": "I have an inspiration, and a hero without wings. The thing is his rap game sings. I cannot wait to see what his next album brings. I was a soldier, and you can bet my dead cold shoulders I cannot bare the wait of waiting any longer. It has been crushing me like a boulder.  I feel like I have been overdosing on Folgers. I got this goofy on my face, and it throws my heart out of pace.Some call it the chase, but really it is something to be cherished by the human race. It is this idea that all other rappers are a disgrace. Think twice as you might be lyrically sliced. Chopped, and diced as a courtesy to the rap king you might have to pay he price. Step to king Shady, your words will go hazy. You might startfeeling a little crazy. Your words might become droopy, and lazy. Just face it a rap skills are a little crazy. Hold your last breathe, because Shady will beat your canadian ass to death XD"
