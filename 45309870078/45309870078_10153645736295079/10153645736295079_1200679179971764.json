        "message": "Dear Eminem, I don't know where to begin. My friend has been down on himself for for over a year now and he needs help. He recently went to the hospital because he tried to commit suicide, he suffers from depression and the drinking isn't helping. I tried to get him to go to counseling and get help but all he wants to do is sleep all day. I've been trying everything that I can think of but I don't know what else to do. He needs help!!! You are his Idol!!! He has vision boards with you on them. Maybe you can get through to him. I don't even know if you read this stuff or if someone else reads it for you but this is a cry for help. I would like for you to talk to him and let him know that life is worth living. Thank you for reading. Sincerely, \nJenele"
