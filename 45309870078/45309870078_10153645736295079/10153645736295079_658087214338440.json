His ability to touch people\u2019s lives like that was incredible.\u201d Beautifully written tribute to Tupac, Marshall... It's Sunday and I just listened to Best Friend- sure do feel what you're saying- especially: Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper\nThis patience of mine is thinner\nThan twine is when I get attacked\nSo I might say something back that might offend you~~ With me, I have a temper that is a switch flip- made into a do-over, it's a whip of the tongue, swallowing my words, if I let my pent-up rage rise, I have to be so careful- the prize may be a fuckers neck cracking, what keeps me in line is the mind on the Kurds, and the Pac-ies- like you said, there is a NWO that is ordered, and I'd rather pack the bubbly than the body bags for the rags-to-riches illuminati~~ this doesn't really rhyme, but I tried my Man"
