That's not why I posted his video either I never said Harry is better I just wanted Em to actually see that there are guys in the world who are mc's in different genres who can spit with crazy word play, not only that but break a record that just so happens to be his. So I'm not here to say who's better I like them both your entitled to your opinion but I must say the video is too short to even hear their actually word play going on in both songs man."
