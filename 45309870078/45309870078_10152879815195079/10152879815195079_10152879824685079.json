So as of now, it's possible MMLP2 was his last solo album, at least until he finds a strong reason to make a new one. Until then he will put songs out here and there and collab and do production and stuff but that's about it.\n\nI do think EVENTUALLY he will make a \"goodbye\" album to rap and his fans."
