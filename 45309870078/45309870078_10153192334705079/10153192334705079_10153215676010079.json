        "message": "Yeah that probably is what happens if  you try to curse God. God has brought me flat on my face too lately.  You know that all seeing eye on money that some people think is the \"illuminati\" . God is the All Seeing Eye that sees every part of your life. Live life with the knowledge that God sees everything you do. If you pick your nose, God sees it. Live life with the knowledge that you are on a hidden camera. ..............Your body is the temple of God. Anything  that you put into your body is an offering to God. Jude 1 verses 12 talks about evil people \"feeding themselves without fear\". ..............\"These are spots in your feast of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear.\" ..................Before you put anything into your body, you should thank God for it and ask Him to bless it to your body. ......................The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\nPsalm 111:10 -\"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.\"\n\nProverbs 9: 8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.\n\n9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.\n\n10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.\n\n11 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.\n\n12 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it."
