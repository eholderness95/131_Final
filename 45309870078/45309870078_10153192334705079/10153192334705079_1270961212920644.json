        "message": "Hey Marshall, I am going to do my clotheschicaslimshady collection and I don't care if you don't give me the permission to do it. I am going to do I legally and then when I had the money I will go to Marshall mathers foundation to do a project to help single parents in crisis like me last year.  Last year I  nearly lose even my life and everything I have  even my kids. I am much better now and I wish to do this collection to help others parents with the similar situation. I don't want you money support cos I am going to do with my own money. I'm not going to give you a penny of what I make cos I know that will go to your twat mug new wifey but I wish to do it in your mum's name to thanks her for giving all the Stan family our idol and an amazing poet. I know that I am your worse nightmare for so many years and I love it cos I have so much fun. I love you my dear friend Marshall. \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e"
