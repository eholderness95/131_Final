I just got brought into the system and had to deal with a bunch of shit... ironically I may have become these things in the process but rsd kept acting like I am a femminist... I don't really even know what that is and still don't. I was just a super unique person in a bad situation a very normal person who stumbled in there... not someone trying to take them down."
