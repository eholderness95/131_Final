        "message": "\u201cI don\u2019t really follow Eminem anymore,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten quite bored of him. I feel like he was really angry when he was in his early 20s and all his music was insanely angry. But nowadays he\u2019s like middle-aged and not angry anymore. He\u2019s faking the anger now \u2014 so the music doesn\u2019t have quite the same passion for me anymore......Eminem dupstep producer is fuckin with yu"
