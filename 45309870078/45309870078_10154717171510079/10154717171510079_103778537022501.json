I am not out that much cause I mean I can still afford tacos and shit sometimes..  Being famous doesn't matter, people wanting to be like me doesn't matter, making real world changes matters and people staying tf out of my business while I eat tacos and smoke weed matters... It just means now that my dreams were stolen I have to make new dreams basically all so I can afford weed and tacos."
