        "message": "Eminem blew up when I was about 18 and going through a bad time. He was the first artist to talk about a lot of stuff I could really relate to.\n\nHad him on my walkmen, then my mp3, bought every album... 18 years later I hadn't listened to him for a while, put headlights on and what an absolute talent he still has. He really is the king of rap."
