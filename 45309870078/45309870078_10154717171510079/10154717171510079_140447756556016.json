        "message": "This is a simultaneous event in my life of some of the most fkd up things all going on in one persons life at once. Training business men who don't know shit, fighting the system, fighting the court, dealing with my child being diagnosed with autism, dealing my son's father having mania and skitzophrenia... dealing with my mother being terminally ill and a cunt that ignored my cries and pleads for help.  Being bullied on every level, having to fight every level of the system, getting my ass beat and having to fight people... starving... it is just a multitude of so much sh.t for just 2.5 years... plus all my work stolen. Finding out these men don't know shit about women and don't care... sexism,  bigotry, profiling , corruption in every system. Oh yeah and losing my home and car and the father of my son."
