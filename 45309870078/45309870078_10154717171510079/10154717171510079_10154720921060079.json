        "message": "Dear Eminem, I have tried sending letters but they all have come back. My son is 26 yrs old but has has 23 surgeries and has been through so much. Every day that he is here is a blessing. He's very smart and can do alot more then i ever thought but he still will never live life like us. He has a shunt and when the put it in the paralyzed the right side of his body. His father took off when he was 4 and has never wanted to see him even though he almost died 3 times. I'm a single parent and i make sure to give and do all I can for him. He's such a sweet boy. But im writing because he adored you\n He doesn't listen to any much but yours. It would mean so much to him if one day he could meet you.  Being a single parent all I want is his happiness. So if you ever could find the time meeting you would mean the world to him. Being a single parent I do anything I can to make him so happy. He deserves it cuz he's my Miracle child. His Facebook is Scott Hockaday and he is your biggest fan. You have my Facebook since I wrote this. Thank you for your time and sorry to bother you its just my son's talks about you Every day."
