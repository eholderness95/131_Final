But I'm here to find a future mr.west that can tell the past one I'm the best. \ud83d\ude05 never harmonised with a voice  perfectly ... Until the other day I hit some notes that were pitch perfect... Harmony was felt in my soul.... Just to let you know Eminem I've written over a trillion songs... Now call me beyond Z a soul driven Aussie Asian American wannabe."
