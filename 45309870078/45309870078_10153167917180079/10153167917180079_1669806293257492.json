        "message": "Dear Eminem, make sure it isn't your thyroid and double-check it if the first test says it's so; I'm saying this because I believe in justice being poetic (although, I'm not talking about the movie, but, I like the movie).  Also, it's because I really love the appearance of your neck and I don't want anyone to deface it.  I don't know you in anyway, obviously; however, girls that don't like a neck natural will try to get you to deface your neck, which will deface their necks in return.  I'm a Jew; maybe it's just a jew thing.  I don't know."
