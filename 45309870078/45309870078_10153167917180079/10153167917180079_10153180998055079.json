        "message": "Hey em, I would like to talk about some stuff in life im going though. Im like you when it comes to the mom department. I got to love here from afar. And a dead beat dad that left before I could start remembering. I have alwayed worked until recently. I became sick with multipe issues and it makes day to day things hard for me know. Its just me and my girl against the world. I just got out of a wreck and my car was totalled, so we have been using a uhaul. We are having to move out of our home of two years because we are struggling so bad right now. Things are tough now but we are survivors. If you can please hit me back just to chat. I hope things are going good for you."
