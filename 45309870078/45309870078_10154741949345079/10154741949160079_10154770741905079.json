        "message": "Why be a King when you can be a god?\nYou don't wanna fuck with Shady. Because Shady will fucking kill you. Ask Faggy too dope and Violent Gay. Their a bunch of little girls why do they act that way? He never meant to give that girl mushrooms and bring her to his world. Now she drinks lysol... He's my role model, that's why I like to drown myself, he never knew he, would ever get this big and affect this kid, but he did, that's why i tried cid and got fucked up worse than his life is. I'm not your biggest fan, I'm not stan, but uh your music speaks volumes and I'm grateful as fuck my dad gave me your cassettes. Your style changed with you , your Marshal Mathers LP will be my favorite album forever yet i know i need to Listen to recovery and replase more so I can better myself and my thinking. \nBless you and your family. \n\nStill waiting for My Salsa.\n-Gary King."
