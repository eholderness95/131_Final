With the years passing by and the number of peas in the  line never growing more then four peas, suddenly, on a sunny day he became revolted. He decided then to dedicate his life to hunt every and any flaws on anyone who were more blessed then him, so he could diss one, and feel a little better about his shitty self. The most happy day in Adam\u00b4s life was when he saw  the King of awesomeness, God of Rap and Major Sir of big dickness, not to be perfect as usual, for a few seconds!! Adam Loman\u00b4s eyes filled with tears, he gave the largest smile of his life filled with euphoria and got back to the pea bag, cause he was sure that he could add at least two more. But not, off course, before he goes to this Rap God\u00b4s page and make fun of him. Even with no actual reason to do it.. but Adam was special, and never nedded a reason to be an asshole in his life. So as soon as he finished his mocking, he got back to his room and with tears in his eyes again, but not happy tears this time, he noticed that his dick still didnt passed a four pea line. He found himself confused and couldnt understand: that trying to decrease the great ones, does not make him any better! When will Adam Loman get it? Lets wait and see, lets cheer for Adam to grow  up and be a man. Maybe, one day, when his dick beggins to shrink even more, he will try to make good use of his brain for the first time in his life and even maybe, just maybe, he gift us all with his silence, wich is the only good thing he has to give. That\u00b4s all folks."
