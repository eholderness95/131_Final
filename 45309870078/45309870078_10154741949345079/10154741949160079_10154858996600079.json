        "message": "Copied to old outdated rapper Eminem this is for you: \n\nHey Em, what up?  I always thought you were the man. \nEvery since the days you rapped about Stan.\n\nI couldn't believe you drew a line in the sand.\nI didn't think I had to decide where to stand?\n\nYou don't want me as a fan?\nIf I don't surrender my opinion to the will of the man?\n\nYou put your hand up high in a fist,\nYou've been corrupted, taken over with rage and you're pissed.\n\nBefore the election I was never a Trump fan,\nPeople like you pushed me, with your line in the sand!\n\nYou scream Fascist, Racist, Dictator boo hoo,\nLook in the mirror yo, that's what you do!\n\nYou're dressed up like ISIS spewing venom to the masses,\nWhat you need to do is buy a new pair of bifocal glasses!\n\nHey Em, I'm from Michigan too, \nI'm too old for rap and so are you!\n\nI'll raise my kids to use their minds to unite,\nNot spew crazy rhetoric to blow our country up like dynamite!\n\nJust want you to know I heard you through and through,\nI'll raise my children to never be like you! \n\nAnd oh, by the way...  forget you too!\n\n#MAGA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8"
