        "message": "\"Like Toy Soldiers\"\n\nStep by step, heart to heart, left right left\nWe all fall down...\n\n[Chorus]\nStep by step, heart to heart, left right left\nWe all fall down like toy soldiers\nBit by bit, torn apart, we never win\nBut the battle wages on for toy soldiers\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure\nEven though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders\nI ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it\nEven if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter\nI'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to\nI'm supposed to set an example\nI need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em\nIf some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em\nThat Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it\nThere's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it\nI heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it\nIt was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit\nAnd even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it\nI spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted\nAnd I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it\nThis ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it\nThat was never my object for someone to get killed\nWhy would I wanna destroy something I help build\nIt wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good\nI went through my whole career without ever mentionin' Suge\nAnd that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth\nAnd talkin' about something that I knew nothing about\nPlus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef\nSo I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth\nWhile he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life\nLike fuck it i understand this is business\nAnd this shit just isn't none of my business\nBut still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme\nAnd wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'\nBut now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it\nThe shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?\nIt's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'\nWe actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'\nMe and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him\nAnd asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him\nUntil Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him\nFuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it\nMeanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions\nSome receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\nHas an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection\nTries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\nBut now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up\nWas through that publication the same one that made me famous\nNow the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'\nWell fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then\nBut I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think\nThat we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.\nAnd he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind\nWe still have soldiers that's on the front line\nThat's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders\nNever to extort us, strictly to show they support us\nWe'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus\nTo show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is\nTo have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners\nTheir loyalty to us is worth more than any award is\nBut I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered\nIt ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it\nThen to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict\nI'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further\nBut don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'\nI'm just willin' to be the bigger man\nIf ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can\nCause frankly I'm sick of talkin'\nI'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause"
