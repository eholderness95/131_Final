        "message": "\"Not Afraid\"\n\n[Chorus:]\nI'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)\nTo take a stand (to take a stand)\nEverybody (everybody)\nCome take my hand (come take my hand)\nWe'll walk this road together, through the storm\nWhatever weather, cold or warm\nJust letting you know that you're not alone\nHoller if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)\n\n[Intro (during Chorus):]\nYeah, it's been a ride\nI guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one\nNow some of you, might still be in that place\nIf you're trying to get out, just follow me\nI'll get you there\n\nYou can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em\nBut you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em\nCause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem\nWhen I say I'ma do something I do it,\nI don't give a damn what you think,\nI'm doing this for me, so fuck the world\nFeed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me\nI'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly\nAnd all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony\nNo ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he\nFrom \"Infinite\" down to the last \"Relapse\" album\nHe's still shitting, whether he's on salary paid hourly\nUntil he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him\nWhichever comes first, for better or worse\nHe's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas\nHis gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge\nTo pull his dick from the dirt, and fuck the whole universe\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOkay quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap\nI shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap\nYou said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that\nFuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped\nAnd to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back\nI promise to never go back on that promise, in fact\nLet's be honest, that last \"Relapse\" CD was ehhh\nPerhaps I ran them accents into the ground\nRelax, I ain't going back to that now\nAll I'm trying to say is get back, click-clack, blow\nCause I ain't playing around\nIt's a game called circle and I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down\nBut I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out\nThought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fucking black cloud\nStill follows me around but it's time to exorcise these demons\nThese motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAnd I just can't keep living this way\nSo starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage\nI'm standing up, I'ma face my demons\nI'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground\nI've had enough, now I'm so fed up\nTime to put my life back together right now! (now)\n\nIt was my decision to get clean, I did it for me\nAdmittedly, I probably did it subliminally\nFor you, so I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through\nAnd don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you\nI been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger\nI think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of\nMy world, haters can make like bees with no stingers\nAnd drop dead, no more beef lingers\nNo more drama from now on, I promise\nTo focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father\nSo I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters\nAnd raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!\nCause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club\nOr the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up\nCause I'm raising the bar\nI'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars\nI feel amazing and I'm...\n\n[Chorus]"
