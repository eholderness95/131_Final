        "message": "No joke, I couldn't gain any more respect for Em, but somehow I did. He commands the audience and absolutely kills every single song, even the rap god verse. The show was by far the best concert I'll ever go to. Rihanna and Eminem is a combination that works amazing for both artists. I also gained some mad respect for Rihanna, the woman is beautiful and can sing. Thanks for the show"
