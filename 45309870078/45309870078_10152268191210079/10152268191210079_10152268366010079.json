It's hard for me to even watch one of his funny movies without crying my eyes out over the loss, i am trying to work up to watching Good Will Hunting again. Yea .. a complete genius. And just an all around great person. I'm grateful to have been alive in the \"era\" of Robin Williams. Very, very sad to see him go ... and the way it happened. Devastating."
