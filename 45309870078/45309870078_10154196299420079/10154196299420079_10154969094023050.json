        "message": "I want to hold each of these people I mentioned earlier accountable for being the ENTIRE reason people in your communities can't get ahead! Because getting them and theirs was more important than helping someone so far down get back up which has been my problem with this country all along! If there is a lawyer who would like to represent me in a Defamation of Character and Harassment suit against Kwik Shop, the Hutchinson Police Department, Good Samaritan Society Hutchinson Village, Hutchinson Hospital and several others please let me know! Should I win that money will be solely used to rebuildour homeless shelter and veteran communities restoring their mental and physical health to whole reintegrating them back to living with people who label them as junkies because they kicked them when they were down. What I have seen out here is 100% FACT not Fiction and we can change this. Even if all you are looking for is your 15 minutes of fame you can do so much for the better in that moment!"
