        "message": "I don't understand this viewpoint. Literally everything that Trump was accused of and said to do during the campaign, is what Eminem raps about: belittling women, being an asshole and not giving a fuck what you say. Not to mention Ems earlier shots at Bill and Hillary it all just doesn't make sense. I'd like to hear an educated opinion of why he really doesn't like him instead of just saying he's a bitch on a track. I like when Eminem gets political, but not bandwagon political like the rest of the celebrities acting like the democrats or Hillary is their savoir. There's a difference between rapping for something you truly feel is wrong, and just hopping on the train because everyone else is. I've prided myself in keeping Eminem as my favorite rapper not just based on his music, but it seems even slim shady has been tamed. Guess that Mk ultra shit where you went to \"rehab\" and weren't seen for five years, really took its grasp"
