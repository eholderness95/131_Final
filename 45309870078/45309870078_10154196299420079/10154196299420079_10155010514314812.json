        "message": "Please help me I'm still in pain everyday. It's hard for me to love my son some times. It hurts so much. Yes I am a survivor of rape. The courts did nothing about it because I was drunk and it was friend. The detective did nothing. The judge did nothing. No one did anything.  I still cannot connect with my son as I should be able to. I thought he was a child of rape and it's never left me. Yet he is still free and has done it to other women unexpectedly as of myself. He was a family friend I though. Turned out he was a rapist. He robed me of my pregnancy with Hadrian and my relationship with him.  Fuck you. Fuck you.  I hurt everyday and still go to therapy because of you.  I wish the law worked buy it failed me. \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22 fuck you. #iamnotashamed #prolife #rapebaby #abbyjohnsonseeme #everylifehaspurpose"
