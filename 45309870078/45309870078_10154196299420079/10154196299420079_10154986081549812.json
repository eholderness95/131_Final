        "message": "I can't express myself on how much of a punk this guy is. He should be grateful for the luxury he enjoys but no! He still has to condem the rest of us to slavery.  Why don't he , for a second, drop his body guards and  come to the south side of Chicago and really have a conversation about life in poverty. Oh wait.    He is too special to be harmed.  I guess the rest of us will just have to find faith in his music.  Like he is some Christ child.  Devil will get his due sooner or later."
