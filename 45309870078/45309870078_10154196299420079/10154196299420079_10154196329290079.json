But then that would be trying to impress ... Dude probably doesn't even give a fuck and is repping with another Detroit rapper for fun. That never crosses anybody's mind though."

            "message": "Yeah I get it. Ditch the choppyness for regular rapping. Hearing his newest stuff I'd agree, but this feature on this song he switches it up enough that it just sounds great. I like, have to listen to this song twice a day. Instead of monotone chopping, he changes tone and flow and the beat compliments the shady side. Starts off with a lower voice that I've had a few friends say they didn't even know it was em. Then throughout he keeps raising pitch until the climax (like a movie) until the trump line. Whole thing gave me shivers the first handful of times."
