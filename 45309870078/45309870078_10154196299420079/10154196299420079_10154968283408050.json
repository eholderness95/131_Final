        "message": "I'm happy he's still rapping. But why does he sound like he's saying the same verse in every song he's made in the last four years? He doesn't sound good in this song at all. Shout, shout, metaphors and more metaphors, shout again. His new sound is hard to like.. the sound of rap god is only cool so many times. Mix it up already. he's always been my favorite but it's fucking hard to like anything he's made lately."
