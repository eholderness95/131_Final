Democratic control is the biggest cause of the failures there so change the leadership and create jobs and lives will improve. Trump is an agent of change and law and order. Three things Michigan and Illinois are desperately in need of. Keeping the same people or parties in power after all the failures is going to do nothing but allow things to continue in the same lousy direction. The problems there are decades old not just a few years!"
