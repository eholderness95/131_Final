As much as I like the gangsta classics and even Andre Nickatina, That is pretty hardcore even if some of his new songs have lame beats. Try reading, Memorizing Tec's lyrics. Then try actually saying them. Its like saying Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 10 times in 3 seconds. Or as family guy would say \"Reciting the fifty states in a second.\""
