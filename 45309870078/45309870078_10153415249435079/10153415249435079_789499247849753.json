        "message": "Yo Em, still looking to play bass for you man. Hit me up at justincorman@gmail.com or you can call me at 561-374-4454 My new band is Bear The Whips, and we're inspired by you BIG TIME. I'm not some fan looking to sponge off of you, I can really play. I could really contribute. I have great instincts for hip-hop (not trying to brag). I hope you'll give me a shot one of these days :). I'd love to show you what I can do!"
