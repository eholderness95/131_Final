American Foundation for Suicide Prevention AFSP does many things to help the community.  I have also taken their class to be able to present More than Sad:Preventing Teen Suicide and Talk Saves Lives, which are two programs that can be presented to schools and community organizations to help shed light\n\nAs a team we can end the stigma around mental illness and suicide and we can start that by showing kindness every day...you never know what journey someone may be on...if we all had empathy and compassion and treated others with kindness instead of hate, this world would become a better place.\nSMILE!! You never know whose life you just may have saved\ud83d\udc99\n\nhttp://theovernight.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=19161"
