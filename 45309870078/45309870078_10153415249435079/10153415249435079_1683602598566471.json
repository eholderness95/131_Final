Time turns but honour is always ready for hates royal rumble... Early it was here we are with no fear ,better yet alone looking for some to help mould a thrown... Rap games remoulded in mastery that's never froze , you diving and he said it's time you dove into a spiral of cones only known as full grown... Words of fear and retaliation but in reality it was for a promotional creation... Said the right thing when it's wrong and the wrong thing when it's right, but all ever seen or heard were them mocking birds all night ."
