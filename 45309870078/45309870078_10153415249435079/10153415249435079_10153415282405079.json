Wtf did u expect? I have lost all hope for rap considering it's nothing but dance music or worse someone trying to brag about what they have or where they come from and how it's so gangster. When the truth is they went to a private school. This guys a gangsta? His real names Clarence.and Clarence lives at home with both parents.  And Clarence parents have a real good marriage.  Point made is that eminem speaks from the heart and leaves it all out there. Especially on stage . U can feel that's he's been thru what he raps about. I don't feel a slight rush when I listen to today's rap. The best I've heard lately is dre on talking to my diary. He actually spit some shit that was heartfelt and true to himself or when he talked about teachers not getting paid enough. It's simple real recognize real and em is definitely the most real out there. As far as living what he raps yes indeed sir that's him. So go ahead and jump on a feed that praises eminem and make it all about race because that's what America has turned into. If u have no other argument bring up race or bigotry. Real classy dude. U are what is wrong with America today. And certainly why we as a nation will be falling before 2026. So I hope u enjoy the racism that Obama fed u thru the news and used to divide our country. Thanks alot for ur useless comment and ur obvious racism towards the white man. So tired of being labeled racist or white loving because I'm white . So go to hell a build a snowman gurrrrrrrrrrrrrrl"
