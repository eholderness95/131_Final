        "message": "Eternity where will you spend eternity? Death is a reality we all must face and the question you need to ask yourself is: Where am I going when I die? The bible says that when we die we either go to HEAVEN OR HELL. To get to heaven on our own merits we must be perfect. However no one is perfect. In fact, we have all sinned against God. We naturally do which is wrong: we lie, steal, lust , hate,... disrespect God, get drunk etc. Because God is good judge he must punish sin and the way he punish sin and the way God will punish us for our sins by sending us to hell for eternity. However God provided the way for you to have your sins forgiven and enter heaven when you die. Jesus Christ came to earth to die on the cross in the place of sinners and 3 days later He rose again, defeating sin and death. To be forgiven of all your sins, you must repent (turn from and forsake your sins) and trust in JESUS death and resurrection as the only means by which all your sins can be forgiven. Please do that today"
