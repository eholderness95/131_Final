A thriving community is one with overflowing resources available for the need of their residents. When resources are pulled out and not replaced with updated ones that community faces a tumbling fall which may take decades to recover. Visit westsideprojecthh.org and view details in the MISSION tab then visit our GO FUND ME to make a difference. A tax deductible receipt will be sent to your in-box for your contributions."
