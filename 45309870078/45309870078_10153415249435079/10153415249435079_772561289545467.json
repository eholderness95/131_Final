        "message": "Has any one realized how positive Marshall is. I've been studying his music often and his messages are great. Be your self, don't bother others, and love your family. He had more positive messages but those are a few. \n\nMy question is do most of you feel the same way. Do you think that he's trying to change the culture of greed in the world by teaching young people to \"just don't give a fuck.\" \nNever in my life have I considered myself a fan. I listened to his music blindly because he made me feel like I wasn't alone. \nI guess my point is that if more of us fans explain exactly why it is we enjoy his music maybe they won't think we're \"crazy\" like they think he is. \nActually, that goes for all things in life. If a person gets an attitude try to be nice, stay calm and take the time to very politely explain why you listen to him. I know it's a hippy dippy way of thinking and no I'm not a fucking pussy. Actually, I'm a Marine. However, the most powerful weapon in this world in true unconditional love. \nIf people are still assholes ignore them and listen to some shady so you can scream I JUST DONT GIVE A FUCK."
