We are fundraising to enable us to grow.  The work we do with live music has an impact on peoples lives who suffer with mental and physical illness. If everyone donated just \u00a31 we would be able to deliver amazing and often life changing experiences.  Thank you so much for taking a minute to read. https://chuffed.org/project/given-to-live"
