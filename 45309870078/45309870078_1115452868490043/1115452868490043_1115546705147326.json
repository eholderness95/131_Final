Trunk Muzik was the dopest shit in a decade when it dropped.\nDude has skills and originality for days. \nBut the honkey tonk banjo fuckin twang is not cutting it. I think it was cool to experiment with but as a fan who's familiar with his entire catalogue I can assure myself that he's beyond this shit. He think he's making quality music, and he is. But he needs to get back to that Yelawolf music. It's even better."
