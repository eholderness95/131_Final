        "message": "I hate to ask this but I have no choice my husband was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia and is undergoing 4-10 weeks of nonstop chemotherapy. He was the bread and butter of the house, working 70 hours a week to take care of me and my premature son whos on oxygen at night because he was born 13 weeks early an also spent 3 month in the NICU. I made a GoFundMe if you want you can share. My husband and I would be so greatful for it. You dont have to but itd be amazing. I really hope you have an amazing day!\n\nhttp://www.gofundme.com/helpbrandon0926"
