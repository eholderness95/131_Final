        "message": "yelawolf  should leave shady records and find another label who is gonna use him...well i respect what slim shady has done in the career of yelawolf but i think the connection is not they...fuck does who think that yelawolf is just a white rapper that makes good sounds but cant be a multi selling artist..he can achieve that...the problem is yelawolf is busy chasing eminem's history and eminem is busy making history....still a long road for him...but as i said he should quit the shady records...and go to a more suitable label"
