        "message": "When you got a \"best friend\" that is by your side until there's no end, \"Till It's Gone\" Walking with you through the \"Daylight\" by your side through moonlight. There might be \"Whiskey In A Bottle\" and you drink until you put the bottle \"Down\" Do you hear the sound? A \"Rap God\"  Who's \"Not Afraid\" of \"The Monster\" that was once made. So let's \"Sing For The Moment\" A \"Mockingbird\" Surprised you all have heard. Let's take a stand, and remember what cards lay in our hand. A dream to be, soon everyone will see. We climb the mountain to drink from the fountain. Face the facts we all get hit with impacts. Chuggin on the train even through the rain. Ups and down where is the solid grounds? Someone somewhere has to hound. Fueling our fire our one true desire music that one day will inspire.\nDonna Rigby"
