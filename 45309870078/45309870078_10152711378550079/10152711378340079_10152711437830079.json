I need the music hes been putting out these last couple of years its embracing, up lifting, it takes me somewhere in my imagination and heart ive never felt the feelings i get from his voice when it hits a mic. he is truely my god and a lot of my generation really needs to take a good long hear at his pain and remorse in his songs now a days. the old shady never left us. he just matured and grew the fuck up something all you \"hood\" gangsta rapper loving people need to fuckin accept. if you loved eminem back then.. but don't now. you were never a Stan to begin with\u270a"

According to the 'language' up there   \u2b06\ufe0f, your head is in the, or, is the clouds \ud83d\udcad\ud83d\udcacor you slurping syrup like Weezy.\n\nNow as far as the EMINEM rumors, I've heard 3, none of witch I can vouch for.\n1, Yelawolf, KID ROCK and EMINEM are going to do an album together\n2, He is going to reunite with the OUTSIDAZ, however, that might not happen because of the dis song Az Izz wrote about EM, so some beef needs to be settled.\n3,He will only produce or just manage his studio. I think it is very unlikely he will make another album, even though I really want him to. And that just sucks."
