Thumbs up for telling me though, but i was already told multiple things about a new album coming from him, but yeah thanks anyways, next person that has to say something that \"hes not leaving\" or \"he has a new album coming out\" i suggest you please save it cause i already know that hes suppodely in the works of a new album we won't know forsure UNTIL it is officially released and also we don't need 10 people in a row telling me basically the same thing.  im just expressing my opinion. If you don't like it. Tough! Get off my comment and express yourself elsewhere like i said NONE OF US NO IF HES GONNA STAY COME BACK LEAVE AGAIN Eminem is very unpredictable so dont be so sure of yourself either talkin bout these new albums you don't even know are coming out forsure \ud83d\ude34"
