        "message": "I'm sure you get a lot of messages from guys trying to get you to listen to their music. My dog Ace Dinero is hard. We both just got out of the joint. I used to tell him when we were in that his shit was killing most of the shit out now. I know with the right backing it's over. If truly appreciate it if you'd take some time and check out some of his shit. He's got music on YouTube under Ace Dinero and Edward Mcquiter. I'm sending a link to One of his songs. \nhttp://youtu.be/L118sGhyR3M"
