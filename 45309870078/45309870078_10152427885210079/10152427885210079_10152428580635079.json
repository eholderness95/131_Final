My friends and everyone around me loved the show and the energy you brought to the stage and as for all those bitching about you saying fuck. Fuck them thats how all the vets i know talk we love the word fuck. I use it all the time they use it and not one of us was offended with how you talked. The words you said we believed you meant and thats what fucking matters."
