        "message": "Those troops fought for freedom of speech and expression. Eminem is a soldier, he is only doing what many people fought and died for. This guy is a lyrical genius, and alot of these losers complaining probably don't understand what he says in his records. I bet he has saved alot of lives with his music, he's been thru some shit and he puts it into song for the whole world to hear and relate to. Alot of his songs are to help people that are in a struggle. I know his lyrics have punched me right in the heart, and sometimes they'll slap ya across the brain and make you think. Continue on Mr. Mathers, you are a legend, and a god to many."
