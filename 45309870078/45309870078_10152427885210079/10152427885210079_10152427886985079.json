Beating animals?  Beating children?  Beating Asians?  Beating homosexuals?  OH!!! Right!!!  He's now a big gay rights activist all the sudden.  Fact is, he can't rap about anything else so he raps about garbage and calls it a joke to inflame people.  Why not rap and try to UNITE people?  Because he can't.  Maybe he can rap rhythmically but he has no intelligent words or context.   I don't care he doesn't give a fuck.  People who have no conscience and live for the almighty dollar don't.  He did this to repair his image, because his managers told him it was a good move, not because he's so involved in current events.  I'm so sure he watches CNN!  lol!"
