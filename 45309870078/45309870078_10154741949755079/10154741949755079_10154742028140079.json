        "message": "Without asking you to be or not in agreement with my poetic vision... Thank you of the deepest of my heart for this proof of respect to the unique thing which, in this world holds me alive, This freedom of expression for which I was born... I have no voice and no skills like yours but i think only hip hop person or MC like you can understand the poetic dream of a fighterr like me...Maybe only a poor loser for every body else but i after all this years i learn my own way to don't care anymore about their non -stop free punch in my  Coucou TROUBADOUR  face !!!\n\nOlivier Campeau"
