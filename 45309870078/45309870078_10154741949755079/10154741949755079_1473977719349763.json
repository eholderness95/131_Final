        "message": "What the fuck? No one ever said that Eminem was the king of rapping fast. Wordplay? Yes, a legend. Flow, honestly pretty average. Speed? Every rapper i listen to can blow him out of the water. Can i see one thing with Eminem's name in it without seeing people compare him to ACTUAL fast rappers? Jesus fuck, people like different genres of music. Get the stick out of your ass and admit that in some aspects, Eminem is a legend and that in others he lacks skill. That goes for all the people who slander Eminem as well. \"Eminem can't rap fast. Eminem has no flow.\" Of course no. He's a fucking storyteller. He gives us a goodass beat and runs through an entire week of events with one goddamn flow without stopping for another topic. That's one of his defining characteristics: wordplay. Goddamn, can't even enjoy rap music because of you little faggots anymore"
