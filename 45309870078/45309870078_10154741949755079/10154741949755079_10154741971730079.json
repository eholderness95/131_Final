You must be brain damaged. Rap God was done over that beat for a reason. If you can't figure out that reason then you should just stay quiet on the subject. Em is where he's at bc of his superior skill and on rap God he performed just about every type of flow there is. There's a reason he did that as well and it wasn't for the fans. To whoever said he doesn't make good songs anymore.....fuck off. Em isn't trying to be relatable emotionally on alot of his newer tracks . He is just displaying his skill. Em has incorporated modern day battle rap into his writing technique and delivering those bars with modern day battle rap stunt work. He's shadow boxing bars. He's syncopating. He's bending the pocket to him. He's flowing to parts of the beat besides the same old bass or snare. He's rhyming on the upbeat and the downbeat and everywhere in between. Hes crossing the bar with his crazy and intricate and creative rhyme schemes. He's left behind the old nursery school style of rhyming and flow and moved on to a super technical and difficult flow that no-one has done before. Oh yes....he's a rap God."

The kids still love him, I still love him, he's going to be around for a long time still. Respect to him because he's come from nothing, at 18, to this massive global icon.
