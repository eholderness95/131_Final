        "message": "I wrote a book that's on Amazon/Kindle called \" The Gutter's Priest \" I pictured you as the ex-con called School ( best friend to Aaron Daniels ; lead character ) , The character \" All Day \" is Morgan Freeman , Pastor Mason is James Earl Jones , I couldn't think of all the bad guys. ( There a lot of them and this book is based on a lot of stuff I went through growing up. I wish you'd have one of your people check out the book to see if it could play. I'm also working on Priest 2 . I think you'd really like this one ( Even more ) Thank you."
