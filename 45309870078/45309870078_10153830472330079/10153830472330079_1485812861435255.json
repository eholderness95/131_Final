        "message": "OMG this looks so good. I JUST missed out on yours and Lil Waynes tickets in Australia by like less then 5 seconds! Never been so heartbroken \ud83d\ude27\ud83d\ude27\ud83d\ude27 Even my husband worships you two and DRE. \nBut most of all, I just wanna say that Eminem, you are my hero, my inspiration, and as someone who can relate to so much of your   music, I just want to say please dont close the curtains again. Ill be honest, after Mockingbird I thought that was it, and then not long later you made relapse and recovery and they topped my album choices for me again. Just keep being you. Proof would be so proud of you \u270c As I KNOW DRE is every single day. Don't give a fuck what anyone says or thinks, just do you. And any duet you make with Rihanna, Dre, or Lil Wayne who is my other fav, each one is a hit. Why not mix all 4 of you together? I guarantee that will be a bombshell! Ive been secretly listening to your CD's since I was about 6 despite my foster mum constantly taking them from me & going crazy, writing down everh single dirty lyric or swearword makinv me read them out loud. and yet here you are. Defying all odds and creating hits time & time again. Also.. not trying to sound like a creep but your daughter has grown into a beautiful woman since the 'my dads gone crazy days' Lol... Youre a wonderful father! I know Im just another person go you, but your not to me. You created the soundtrack of my life. \nLove ya Em, truly, your biggest fan, Karisa xxx \u270c\ud83d\udc99"
