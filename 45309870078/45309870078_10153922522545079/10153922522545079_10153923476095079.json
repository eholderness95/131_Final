The cause of Terrorism is not Muslim extremism. The cause is \"greedy military interventions.\" Religion is used as propaganda on both sides of the War on Terrorism.\n\nThe outsourcing of U.S. jobs and illegal immigration are the result of foreign trade policy that focuses on business interests at the expense of workers' rights and the environment protection. We don't have to build a wall. The answer is trade policy that gradually increase wages and regulations abroad not lower them here.\n\nGreen Party For President and Local and State Berniecrats"
