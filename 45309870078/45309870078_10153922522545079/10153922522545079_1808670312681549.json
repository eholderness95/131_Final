        "message": "I hate to be that guy who's comment is totally unrelated but I'm raising money so a 5 year old boy can go to America for laser surgery on a rare brain tumour, I've set up a just giving page to try and get \u00a31000 and I'm asking if people could donate anything at all even just the odd pennies in your bank. And as a thank you when I've reached the target, the name of one person who donated will be picked at random then I'll get that name tattooed on my bum. There's other deals as well, the just giving page is \nhttps://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/Fundfinley\nIf you can't donate, I'd be extremely grateful if you could just share this link, to get as much publicity for this cause as possible, thanks."
