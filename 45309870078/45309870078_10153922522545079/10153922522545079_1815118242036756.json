        "message": "Happy belated birthday first off,, but I really want you to know my 16 Yr old daughter really loved your music,, she was not even born yet when marshal Mather's LP came out, but I loved your music so my daughter Kayden Hamilton grew up on your music, she loved rap god, her favorite song, my reason for commenting is, she was only 16 and hurt and she took her life on Nov 9, I'm her mother and I'm hurt, but I know she is strength for a lot of young people with struggles,, I just ask you recognize her as a great young girl, my baby girl, I'm so raising awareness on suicide,, to value life, it is so short,, and my daughter loved your music old school to, thank you Eminem"
